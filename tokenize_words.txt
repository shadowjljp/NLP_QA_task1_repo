The
exact
nature
of
relations
between
Tibet
and
the
Ming
dynasty
of
China
(
1368
–
1644
)
is
unclear
.
Analysis
of
the
relationship
is
further
complicated
by
modern
political
conflicts
and
the
application
of
Westphalian
sovereignty
to
a
time
when
the
concept
did
not
exist
.
Some
Mainland
Chinese
scholars
,
such
as
Wang
Jiawei
and
Nyima
Gyaincain
,
assert
that
the
Ming
dynasty
had
unquestioned
sovereignty
over
Tibet
,
pointing
to
the
Ming
court
's
issuing
of
various
titles
to
Tibetan
leaders
,
Tibetans
'
full
acceptance
of
these
titles
,
and
a
renewal
process
for
successors
of
these
titles
that
involved
traveling
to
the
Ming
capital
.
Scholars
within
China
also
argue
that
Tibet
has
been
an
integral
part
of
China
since
the
13th
century
and
that
it
was
thus
a
part
of
the
Ming
Empire
.
But
most
scholars
outside
China
,
such
as
Turrell
V.
Wylie
,
Melvin
C.
Goldstein
,
and
Helmut
Hoffman
,
say
that
the
relationship
was
one
of
suzerainty
,
that
Ming
titles
were
only
nominal
,
that
Tibet
remained
an
independent
region
outside
Ming
control
,
and
that
it
simply
paid
tribute
until
the
Jiajing
Emperor
(
1521
–
1566
)
,
who
ceased
relations
with
Tibet
.
Some
scholars
note
that
Tibetan
leaders
during
the
Ming
frequently
engaged
in
civil
war
and
conducted
their
own
foreign
diplomacy
with
neighboring
states
such
as
Nepal
.
Some
scholars
underscore
the
commercial
aspect
of
the
Ming-Tibetan
relationship
,
noting
the
Ming
dynasty
's
shortage
of
horses
for
warfare
and
thus
the
importance
of
the
horse
trade
with
Tibet
.
Others
argue
that
the
significant
religious
nature
of
the
relationship
of
the
Ming
court
with
Tibetan
lamas
is
underrepresented
in
modern
scholarship
.
In
hopes
of
reviving
the
unique
relationship
of
the
earlier
Mongol
leader
Kublai
Khan
(
r.
1260
–
1294
)
and
his
spiritual
superior
Drogön
Chögyal
Phagpa
(
1235
–
1280
)
of
the
Sakya
school
of
Tibetan
Buddhism
,
the
Yongle
Emperor
(
r.
1402
–
1424
)
made
a
concerted
effort
to
build
a
secular
and
religious
alliance
with
Deshin
Shekpa
(
1384
–
1415
)
,
the
Karmapa
of
the
Karma
Kagyu
school
.
However
,
the
Yongle
Emperor
's
attempts
were
unsuccessful
.
The
Ming
initiated
sporadic
armed
intervention
in
Tibet
during
the
14th
century
,
but
did
not
garrison
permanent
troops
there
.
At
times
the
Tibetans
also
used
armed
resistance
against
Ming
forays
.
The
Wanli
Emperor
(
r.
1572
–
1620
)
made
attempts
to
reestablish
Sino-Tibetan
relations
after
the
Mongol-Tibetan
alliance
initiated
in
1578
,
which
affected
the
foreign
policy
of
the
subsequent
Qing
dynasty
(
1644
–
1912
)
of
China
in
their
support
for
the
Dalai
Lama
of
the
Gelug
school
.
By
the
late
16th
century
,
the
Mongols
were
successful
armed
protectors
of
the
Gelug
Dalai
Lama
,
after
increasing
their
presence
in
the
Amdo
region
.
This
culminated
in
Güshi
Khan
's
(
1582
–
1655
)
conquest
of
Tibet
from
1637
–
1642
and
the
establishment
of
the
Ganden
Phodrang
regime
by
the
5th
Dalai
Lama
with
his
help
.
Tibet
was
once
a
strong
power
contemporaneous
with
Tang
China
(
618–907
)
.
Until
the
Tibetan
Empire
's
collapse
in
the
9th
century
,
it
was
the
Tang
's
major
rival
in
dominating
Inner
Asia
.
The
Yarlung
rulers
of
Tibet
also
signed
various
peace
treaties
with
the
Tang
,
culminating
in
a
treaty
in
821
that
fixed
the
borders
between
Tibet
and
China
.
During
the
Five
Dynasties
and
Ten
Kingdoms
period
of
China
(
907–960
)
,
while
the
fractured
political
realm
of
China
saw
no
threat
in
a
Tibet
which
was
in
just
as
much
political
disarray
,
there
was
little
in
the
way
of
Sino-Tibetan
relations
.
Few
documents
involving
Sino-Tibetan
contacts
survive
from
the
Song
dynasty
(
960
–
1279
)
.
The
Song
were
far
more
concerned
with
countering
northern
enemy
states
of
the
Khitan-ruled
Liao
dynasty
(
907
–
1125
)
and
Jurchen-ruled
Jin
dynasty
(
1115
–
1234
)
.
In
1207
,
the
Mongol
ruler
Genghis
Khan
(
r.
1206
–
1227
)
conquered
and
subjugated
the
ethnic
Tangut
state
of
the
Western
Xia
(
1038
–
1227
)
.
In
the
same
year
,
he
established
diplomatic
relations
with
Tibet
by
sending
envoys
there
.
The
conquest
of
the
Western
Xia
alarmed
Tibetan
rulers
,
who
decided
to
pay
tribute
to
the
Mongols
.
However
,
when
they
ceased
to
pay
tribute
after
Genghis
Khan
's
death
,
his
successor
Ögedei
Khan
(
r.
1229
–
1241
)
launched
an
invasion
into
Tibet
.
The
Mongol
prince
Godan
,
a
grandson
of
Genghis
Khan
,
raided
as
far
as
Lhasa
.
During
his
attack
in
1240
,
Prince
Godan
summoned
Sakya
Pandita
(
1182
–
1251
)
,
leader
of
the
Sakya
school
of
Tibetan
Buddhism
,
to
his
court
in
what
is
now
Gansu
in
Western
China
.
With
Sakya
Pandita
's
submission
to
Godan
in
1247
,
Tibet
was
officially
incorporated
into
the
Mongol
Empire
during
the
regency
of
Töregene
Khatun
(
1241
–
1246
)
.
Michael
C.
van
Walt
van
Praag
writes
that
Godan
granted
Sakya
Pandita
temporal
authority
over
a
still
politically
fragmented
Tibet
,
stating
that
"
this
investiture
had
little
real
impact
"
but
it
was
significant
in
that
it
established
the
unique
"
Priest-
Patron
"
relationship
between
the
Mongols
and
the
Sakya
lamas
.
Starting
in
1236
,
the
Mongol
prince
Kublai
,
who
later
ruled
as
Khagan
from
1260
–
1294
,
was
granted
a
large
appanage
in
North
China
by
his
superior
,
Ögedei
Khan
.
Karma
Pakshi
,
2nd
Karmapa
Lama
(
1203
–
1283
)
—
the
head
lama
of
the
Karma
Kagyu
lineage
of
Tibetan
Buddhism
—
rejected
Kublai
's
invitation
,
so
instead
Kublai
invited
Drogön
Chögyal
Phagpa
(
1235
–
1280
)
,
successor
and
nephew
of
Sakya
Pandita
,
who
came
to
his
court
in
1253
.
Kublai
instituted
a
unique
relationship
with
the
Phagpa
lama
,
which
recognized
Kublai
as
a
superior
sovereign
in
political
affairs
and
the
Phagpa
lama
as
the
senior
instructor
to
Kublai
in
religious
affairs
.
Kublai
also
made
Drogön
Chögyal
Phagpa
the
director
of
the
government
agency
known
as
the
Bureau
of
Buddhist
and
Tibetan
Affairs
and
the
ruling
priest-king
of
Tibet
,
which
comprised
thirteen
different
states
ruled
by
myriarchies
.
Kublai
Khan
did
not
conquer
the
Song
dynasty
in
South
China
until
1279
,
so
Tibet
was
a
component
of
the
early
Mongol
Empire
before
it
was
combined
into
one
of
its
descendant
empires
with
the
whole
of
China
under
the
Yuan
dynasty
(
1271
–
1368
)
.
Van
Praag
writes
that
this
conquest
"
marked
the
end
of
independent
China
,
"
which
was
then
incorporated
into
the
Yuan
dynasty
that
ruled
China
,
Tibet
,
Mongolia
,
Korea
,
parts
of
Siberia
and
Upper
Burma
.
Morris
Rossabi
,
a
professor
of
Asian
history
at
Queens
College
,
City
University
of
New
York
,
writes
that
"
Khubilai
wished
to
be
perceived
both
as
the
legitimate
Khan
of
Khans
of
the
Mongols
and
as
the
Emperor
of
China
.
Though
he
had
,
by
the
early
1260s
,
become
closely
identified
with
China
,
he
still
,
for
a
time
,
claimed
universal
rule
"
,
and
yet
"
despite
his
successes
in
China
and
Korea
,
Khubilai
was
unable
to
have
himself
accepted
as
the
Great
Khan
"
.
Thus
,
with
such
limited
acceptance
of
his
position
as
Great
Khan
,
Kublai
Khan
increasingly
became
identified
with
China
and
sought
support
as
Emperor
of
China
.
In
1358
,
the
Sakya
viceregal
regime
installed
by
the
Mongols
in
Tibet
was
overthrown
in
a
rebellion
by
the
Phagmodru
myriarch
Tai
Situ
Changchub
Gyaltsen
(
1302
–
1364
)
.
The
Mongol
Yuan
court
was
forced
to
accept
him
as
the
new
viceroy
,
and
Changchub
Gyaltsen
and
his
successors
,
the
Phagmodrupa
Dynasty
,
gained
de
facto
rule
over
Tibet
.
In
1368
,
a
Han
Chinese
revolt
known
as
the
Red
Turban
Rebellion
toppled
the
Mongol
Yuan
dynasty
in
China
.
Zhu
Yuanzhang
then
established
the
Ming
dynasty
,
ruling
as
the
Hongwu
Emperor
(
r.
1368
–
1398
)
.
It
is
not
clear
how
much
the
early
Ming
court
understood
the
civil
war
going
on
in
Tibet
between
rival
religious
sects
,
but
the
first
emperor
was
anxious
to
avoid
the
same
trouble
that
Tibet
had
caused
for
the
Tang
dynasty
.
Instead
of
recognizing
the
Phagmodru
ruler
,
the
Hongwu
Emperor
sided
with
the
Karmapa
of
the
nearer
Kham
region
and
southeastern
Tibet
,
sending
envoys
out
in
the
winter
of
1372
–
1373
to
ask
the
Yuan
officeholders
to
renew
their
titles
for
the
new
Ming
court
.
As
evident
in
his
imperial
edicts
,
the
Hongwu
Emperor
was
well
aware
of
the
Buddhist
link
between
Tibet
and
China
and
wanted
to
foster
it
.
Rolpe
Dorje
,
4th
Karmapa
Lama
(
1340
–
1383
)
rejected
the
Hongwu
Emperor
's
invitation
,
although
he
did
send
some
disciples
as
envoys
to
the
court
in
Nanjing
.
The
Hongwu
Emperor
also
entrusted
his
guru
Zongluo
,
one
of
many
Buddhist
monks
at
court
,
to
head
a
religious
mission
into
Tibet
in
1378
–
1382
in
order
to
obtain
Buddhist
texts
.
However
,
the
early
Ming
government
enacted
a
law
,
later
rescinded
,
which
forbade
Han
Chinese
to
learn
the
tenets
of
Tibetan
Buddhism
.
There
is
little
detailed
evidence
of
Chinese
—
especially
lay
Chinese
—
studying
Tibetan
Buddhism
until
the
Republican
era
(
1912
–
1949
)
.
Despite
these
missions
on
behalf
of
the
Hongwu
Emperor
,
Morris
Rossabi
writes
that
the
Yongle
Emperor
(
r.
1402
–
1424
)
"
was
the
first
Ming
ruler
actively
to
seek
an
extension
of
relations
with
Tibet
.
"
According
to
the
official
Twenty
-
Four
Histories
,
the
History
of
Ming
compiled
in
1739
by
the
subsequent
Qing
dynasty
(
1644
–
1912
)
,
the
Ming
dynasty
established
the
"
É-
Lì
-
Sī
Army
-
Civilian
Marshal
Office
"
(
Chinese
:
俄力思軍民元帥府
)
in
western
Tibet
and
installed
the
"
Ü-
Tsang
Itinerant
High
Commandery
"
and
"
Amdo
-
Kham
Itinerant
High
Commandery
"
to
administer
Kham
.
The
Mingshi
states
that
administrative
offices
were
set
up
under
these
high
commanderies
,
including
one
Itinerant
Commandery
,
three
Pacification
Commissioner
's
Offices
,
six
Expedition
Commissioner
's
Offices
,
four
Wanhu
offices
(
myriarchies
,
in
command
of
10,000
households
each
)
and
seventeen
Qianhu
offices
(
chiliarchies
,
each
in
command
of
1,000
households
)
.
The
Ming
court
appointed
three
Princes
of
Dharma
(
法王
)
and
five
Princes
(
王
)
,
and
granted
many
other
titles
,
such
as
Grand
State
Tutors
(
大國師
)
and
State
Tutors
(
國師
)
,
to
the
important
schools
of
Tibetan
Buddhism
,
including
the
Karma
Kagyu
,
Sakya
,
and
Gelug
.
According
to
Wang
Jiawei
and
Nyima
Gyaincain
,
leading
officials
of
these
organs
were
all
appointed
by
the
central
government
and
were
subject
to
the
rule
of
law
.
Yet
Van
Praag
describes
the
distinct
and
long-lasting
Tibetan
law
code
established
by
the
Phagmodru
ruler
Tai
Situ
Changchub
Gyaltsen
as
one
of
many
reforms
to
revive
old
Imperial
Tibetan
traditions
.
The
late
Turrell
V.
Wylie
,
a
former
professor
of
the
University
of
Washington
,
and
Li
Tieh-tseng
argue
that
the
reliability
of
the
heavily
censored
History
of
Ming
as
a
credible
source
on
Sino-Tibetan
relations
is
questionable
,
in
the
light
of
modern
scholarship
.
Other
historians
also
assert
that
these
Ming
titles
were
nominal
and
did
not
actually
confer
the
authority
that
the
earlier
Yuan
titles
had
.
Van
Praag
writes
that
the
"
numerous
economically
motivated
Tibetan
missions
to
the
Ming
Court
are
referred
to
as
'
tributary
missions
'
in
the
Ming
Shih
.
"
Van
Praag
writes
that
these
"
tributary
missions
"
were
simply
prompted
by
China
's
need
for
horses
from
Tibet
,
since
a
viable
horse
market
in
Mongol
lands
was
closed
as
a
result
of
incessant
conflict
.
Morris
Rossabi
also
writes
that
"
Tibet
,
which
had
extensive
contacts
with
China
during
the
Yuan
,
scarcely
had
diplomatic
relations
with
the
Ming
.
"
Historians
disagree
on
what
the
relationship
was
between
the
Ming
court
and
Tibet
and
whether
or
not
Ming
China
had
sovereignty
over
Tibet
.
Van
Praag
writes
that
Chinese
court
historians
viewed
Tibet
as
an
independent
foreign
tributary
and
had
little
interest
in
Tibet
besides
a
lama-patron
relationship
.
The
historian
Tsepon
W.
D.
Shakabpa
supports
van
Praag
's
position
.
However
,
Wang
Jiawei
and
Nyima
Gyaincain
state
that
these
assertions
by
van
Praag
and
Shakabpa
are
"
fallacies
"
.
Wang
and
Nyima
argue
that
the
Ming
emperor
sent
edicts
to
Tibet
twice
in
the
second
year
of
the
Ming
dynasty
,
and
demonstrated
that
he
viewed
Tibet
as
a
significant
region
to
pacify
by
urging
various
Tibetan
tribes
to
submit
to
the
authority
of
the
Ming
court
.
They
note
that
at
the
same
time
,
the
Mongol
Prince
Punala
,
who
had
inherited
his
position
as
ruler
of
areas
of
Tibet
,
went
to
Nanjing
in
1371
to
pay
tribute
and
show
his
allegiance
to
the
Ming
court
,
bringing
with
him
the
seal
of
authority
issued
by
the
Yuan
court
.
They
also
state
that
since
successors
of
lamas
granted
the
title
of
"
prince
"
had
to
travel
to
the
Ming
court
to
renew
this
title
,
and
since
lamas
called
themselves
princes
,
the
Ming
court
therefore
had
"
full
sovereignty
over
Tibet
.
"
They
state
that
the
Ming
dynasty
,
by
issuing
imperial
edicts
to
invite
ex
-Yuan
officials
to
the
court
for
official
positions
in
the
early
years
of
its
founding
,
won
submission
from
ex-Yuan
religious
and
administrative
leaders
in
the
Tibetan
areas
,
and
thereby
incorporated
Tibetan
areas
into
the
rule
of
the
Ming
court
.
Thus
,
they
conclude
,
the
Ming
court
won
the
power
to
rule
Tibetan
areas
formerly
under
the
rule
of
the
Yuan
dynasty
.
Journalist
and
author
Thomas
Laird
,
in
his
book
The
Story
of
Tibet
:
Conversations
with
the
Dalai
Lama
,
writes
that
Wang
and
Nyima
present
the
government
viewpoint
of
the
People
's
Republic
of
China
in
their
Historical
Status
of
China's
Tibet
,
and
fail
to
realize
that
China
was
"
absorbed
into
a
larger
,
non
-
Chinese
political
unit
"
during
the
Mongol
Yuan
dynasty
,
which
Wang
and
Nyima
paint
as
a
characteristic
Chinese
dynasty
succeeded
by
the
Ming
.
Laird
asserts
that
the
ruling
Mongol
khans
never
administered
Tibet
as
part
of
China
and
instead
ruled
them
as
separate
territories
,
comparing
the
Mongols
with
the
British
who
colonized
India
and
New
Zealand
,
yet
stating
this
does
not
make
India
part
of
New
Zealand
as
a
consequence
.
Of
later
Mongol
and
Tibetan
accounts
interpreting
the
Mongol
conquest
of
Tibet
,
Laird
asserts
that
"
they
,
like
all
non
-Chinese
historical
narratives
,
never
portray
the
Mongol
subjugation
of
Tibet
as
a
Chinese
one
.
"
The
Columbia
Encyclopedia
distinguishes
between
the
Yuan
dynasty
and
the
other
Mongol
Empire
khanates
of
Ilkhanate
,
Chagatai
Khanate
and
the
Golden
Horde
.
It
describes
the
Yuan
dynasty
as
"
A
Mongol
dynasty
of
China
that
ruled
from
1271
to
1368
,
and
a
division
of
the
great
empire
conquered
by
the
Mongols
.
Founded
by
Kublai
Khan
,
who
adopted
the
Chinese
dynastic
name
of
Yüan
in
1271
.
"
The
Encyclopedia
Americana
describes
the
Yuan
dynasty
as
"
the
line
of
Mongol
rulers
in
China
"
and
adds
that
the
Mongols
"
proclaimed
a
Chinese-style
Yüan
dynasty
at
Khanbaliq
(
Beijing
)
.
"
The
Metropolitan
Museum
of
Art
writes
that
the
Mongol
rulers
of
the
Yuan
dynasty
"
adopted
Chinese
political
and
cultural
models
;
ruling
from
their
capitals
in
Dadu
,
they
assumed
the
role
of
Chinese
emperors
,
"
although
Tibetologist
Thomas
Laird
dismissed
the
Yuan
dynasty
as
a
non-Chinese
polity
and
plays
down
its
Chinese
characteristics
.
The
Metropolitan
Museum
of
Art
also
noted
that
in
spite
of
the
gradual
assimilation
of
Yuan
monarchs
,
the
Mongol
rulers
largely
ignored
the
literati
and
imposed
harsh
policies
discriminating
against
southern
Chinese
.
In
his
Kublai
Khan
:
His
Life
and
Times
,
Rossabi
explains
that
Kublai
"
created
government
institutions
that
either
resembled
or
were
the
same
as
the
traditional
Chinese
ones
"
,
and
he
"
wished
to
signal
to
the
Chinese
that
he
intended
to
adopt
the
trappings
and
style
of
a
Chinese
ruler
"
.
Nevertheless
,
the
ethno-geographic
caste
hierarchy
favoring
the
Mongols
and
other
ethnicities
were
accorded
higher
status
than
the
Han
Chinese
majority
.
Although
Han
Chinese
who
were
recruited
as
advisers
were
often
actually
more
influential
than
high
officials
,
their
status
was
not
as
well
defined
.
Kublai
also
abolished
the
imperial
examinations
of
China
's
civil
service
legacy
,
which
was
not
reinstated
until
Ayurbarwada
Buyantu
Khan
's
reign
(
1311
–
1320
)
.
Rossabi
writes
that
Kublai
recognized
that
in
order
to
rule
China
,
"
he
had
to
employ
Chinese
advisors
and
officials
,
yet
he
could
not
rely
totally
on
Chinese
advisers
because
he
had
to
maintain
a
delicate
balancing
act
between
ruling
the
sedentary
civilization
of
China
and
preserving
the
cultural
identity
and
values
of
the
Mongols
.
"
And
"
in
governing
China
,
he
was
concerned
with
the
interests
of
his
Chinese
subjects
,
but
also
with
exploiting
the
resources
of
the
empire
for
his
own
aggrandizement
.
His
motivations
and
objectives
alternated
from
one
to
the
other
throughout
his
reign
,
"
according
to
Rossabi
.
Van
Praag
writes
in
The
Status
of
Tibet
that
the
Tibetans
and
Mongols
,
on
the
other
hand
,
upheld
a
dual
system
of
rule
and
an
interdependent
relationship
that
legitimated
the
succession
of
Mongol
khans
as
universal
Buddhist
rulers
,
or
chakravartin
.
Van
Praag
writes
that
"
Tibet
remained
a
unique
part
of
the
Empire
and
was
never
fully
integrated
into
it
,
"
citing
examples
such
as
a
licensed
border
market
that
existed
between
China
and
Tibet
during
the
Yuan
.
The
official
position
of
the
Ministry
of
Foreign
Affairs
of
the
People
's
Republic
of
China
is
that
the
Ming
implemented
a
policy
of
managing
Tibet
according
to
conventions
and
customs
,
granting
titles
and
setting
up
administrative
organs
over
Tibet
.
The
State
Council
Information
Office
of
the
People's
Republic
states
that
the
Ming
dynasty
's
Ü-Tsang
Commanding
Office
governed
most
areas
of
Tibet
.
It
also
states
that
while
the
Ming
abolished
the
policy
council
set
up
by
the
Mongol
Yuan
to
manage
local
affairs
in
Tibet
and
the
Mongol
system
of
Imperial
Tutors
to
govern
religious
affairs
,
the
Ming
adopted
a
policy
of
bestowing
titles
upon
religious
leaders
who
had
submitted
to
the
Ming
dynasty
.
For
example
,
an
edict
of
the
Hongwu
Emperor
in
1373
appointed
the
Tibetan
leader
Choskunskyabs
as
the
General
of
the
Ngari
Military
and
Civil
Wanhu
Office
,
stating
:
Chen
Qingying
,
Professor
of
History
and
Director
of
the
History
Studies
Institute
under
the
China
Tibetology
Research
Center
in
Beijing
,
writes
that
the
Ming
court
conferred
new
official
positions
on
ex-Yuan
Tibetan
leaders
of
the
Phachu
Kargyu
and
granted
them
lower
-
ranking
positions
.
Of
the
county
(
zong
or
dzong
)
leaders
of
Neiwo
Zong
and
Renbam
Zong
,
Chen
states
that
when
"
the
Emperor
learned
the
actual
situation
of
the
Phachu
Kargyu
,
the
Ming
court
then
appointed
the
main
Zong
leaders
to
be
senior
officers
of
the
Senior
Command
of
Dbus
and
Gtsang
.
"
The
official
posts
that
the
Ming
court
established
in
Tibet
,
such
as
senior
and
junior
commanders
,
offices
of
Qianhu
(
in
charge
of
1,000
households
)
,
and
offices
of
Wanhu
(
in
charge
of
10,000
households
)
,
were
all
hereditary
positions
according
to
Chen
,
but
he
asserts
that
"
the
succession
of
some
important
posts
still
had
to
be
approved
by
the
emperor
,
"
while
old
imperial
mandates
had
to
be
returned
to
the
Ming
court
for
renewal
.
According
to
Tibetologist
John
Powers
,
Tibetan
sources
counter
this
narrative
of
titles
granted
by
the
Chinese
to
Tibetans
with
various
titles
which
the
Tibetans
gave
to
the
Chinese
emperors
and
their
officials
.
Tribute
missions
from
Tibetan
monasteries
to
the
Chinese
court
brought
back
not
only
titles
,
but
large
,
commercially
valuable
gifts
which
could
subsequently
be
sold
.
The
Ming
emperors
sent
invitations
to
ruling
lamas
,
but
the
lamas
sent
subordinates
rather
than
coming
themselves
,
and
no
Tibetan
ruler
ever
explicitly
accepted
the
role
of
being
a
vassal
of
the
Ming
.
Hans
Bielenstein
writes
that
as
far
back
as
the
Han
dynasty
(
202
BCE
–
220
CE
)
,
the
Han
Chinese
government
"
maintained
the
fiction
"
that
the
foreign
officials
administering
the
various
"
Dependent
States
"
and
oasis
city
-states
of
the
Western
Regions
(
composed
of
the
Tarim
Basin
and
oasis
of
Turpan
)
were
true
Han
representatives
due
to
the
Han
government
's
conferral
of
Chinese
seals
and
seal
cords
to
them
.
Wang
and
Nyima
state
that
after
the
official
title
"
Education
Minister
"
was
granted
to
Tai
Situ
Changchub
Gyaltsen
(
1302
–
1364
)
by
the
Yuan
court
,
this
title
appeared
frequently
with
his
name
in
various
Tibetan
texts
,
while
his
Tibetan
title
"
Degsi
"
(
sic
properly
sde-srid
or
desi
)
is
seldom
mentioned
.
Wang
and
Nyima
take
this
to
mean
that
"
even
in
the
later
period
of
the
Yuan
dynasty
,
the
Yuan
imperial
court
and
the
Phagmodrupa
Dynasty
maintained
a
Central-
local
government
relation
.
"
The
Tai
Situpa
is
even
supposed
to
have
written
in
his
will
:
"
In
the
past
I
received
loving
care
from
the
emperor
in
the
east
.
If
the
emperor
continues
to
care
for
us
,
please
follow
his
edicts
and
the
imperial
envoy
should
be
well
received
.
"
However
,
Lok-Ham
Chan
,
a
professor
of
history
at
the
University
of
Washington
,
writes
that
Changchub
Gyaltsen
's
aims
were
to
recreate
the
old
Tibetan
Kingdom
that
existed
during
the
Chinese
Tang
dynasty
,
to
build
"
nationalist
sentiment
"
amongst
Tibetans
,
and
to
"
remove
all
traces
of
Mongol
suzerainty
.
"
Georges
Dreyfus
,
a
professor
of
religion
at
Williams
College
,
writes
that
it
was
Changchub
Gyaltsen
who
adopted
the
old
administrative
system
of
Songtsän
Gampo
(
c.
605
–
649
)
—
the
first
leader
of
the
Tibetan
Empire
to
establish
Tibet
as
a
strong
power
—
by
reinstating
its
legal
code
of
punishments
and
administrative
units
.
For
example
,
instead
of
the
13
governorships
established
by
the
Mongol
Sakya
viceroy
,
Changchub
Gyaltsen
divided
Central
Tibet
into
districts
(
dzong
)
with
district
heads
(
dzong
dpon
)
who
had
to
conform
to
old
rituals
and
wear
clothing
styles
of
old
Imperial
Tibet
.
Van
Praag
asserts
that
Changchub
Gyaltsen
's
ambitions
were
to
"
restore
to
Tibet
the
glories
of
its
Imperial
Age
"
by
reinstating
secular
administration
,
promoting
"
national
culture
and
traditions
,
"
and
installing
a
law
code
that
survived
into
the
20th
century
.
According
to
Chen
,
the
Ming
officer
of
Hezhou
(
modern
day
Linxia
)
informed
the
Hongwu
Emperor
that
the
general
situation
in
Dbus
and
Gtsang
"
was
under
control
,
"
and
so
he
suggested
to
the
emperor
that
he
offer
the
second
Phagmodru
ruler
,
Jamyang
Shakya
Gyaltsen
,
an
official
title
.
According
to
the
Records
of
the
Founding
Emperor
,
the
Hongwu
Emperor
issued
an
edict
granting
the
title
"
Initiation
State
Master
"
to
Sagya
Gyaincain
,
while
the
latter
sent
envoys
to
the
Ming
court
to
hand
over
his
jade
seal
of
authority
along
with
tribute
of
colored
silk
and
satin
,
statues
of
the
Buddha
,
Buddhist
scriptures
,
and
sarira
.
Dreyfus
writes
that
after
the
Phagmodrupa
lost
its
centralizing
power
over
Tibet
in
1434
,
several
attempts
by
other
families
to
establish
hegemonies
failed
over
the
next
two
centuries
until
1642
with
the
5th
Dalai
Lama
's
effective
hegemony
over
Tibet
.
The
Ming
dynasty
granted
titles
to
lamas
of
schools
such
as
the
Karmapa
Kargyu
,
but
the
latter
had
previously
declined
Mongol
invitations
to
receive
titles
.
When
the
Ming
Yongle
Emperor
invited
Je
Tsongkhapa
(
1357
–
1419
)
,
founder
of
the
Gelug
school
,
to
come
to
the
Ming
court
and
pay
tribute
,
the
latter
declined
.
Wang
and
Nyima
write
that
this
was
due
to
old
age
and
physical
weakness
,
and
also
because
of
efforts
being
made
to
build
three
major
monasteries
.
Chen
Qingying
states
that
Tsongkhapa
wrote
a
letter
to
decline
the
Emperor
's
invitation
,
and
in
this
reply
,
Tsongkhapa
wrote
:
A.
Tom
Grunfeld
says
that
Tsongkhapa
claimed
ill
health
in
his
refusal
to
appear
at
the
Ming
court
,
while
Rossabi
adds
that
Tsongkhapa
cited
the
"
length
and
arduousness
of
the
journey
"
to
China
as
another
reason
not
to
make
an
appearance
.
This
first
request
by
the
Ming
was
made
in
1407
,
but
the
Ming
court
sent
another
embassy
in
1413
,
this
one
led
by
the
eunuch
Hou
Xian
(
候顯
;
fl.
1403
–
1427
)
,
which
was
again
refused
by
Tsongkhapa
.
Rossabi
writes
that
Tsongkhapa
did
not
want
to
entirely
alienate
the
Ming
court
,
so
he
sent
his
disciple
Chosrje
Shākya
Yeshes
to
Nanjing
in
1414
on
his
behalf
,
and
upon
his
arrival
in
1415
the
Yongle
Emperor
bestowed
upon
him
the
title
of
"
State
Teacher
"
—
the
same
title
earlier
awarded
the
Phagmodrupa
ruler
of
Tibet
.
The
Xuande
Emperor
(
r.
1425
–
1435
)
even
granted
this
disciple
Chosrje
Shākya
Yeshes
the
title
of
a
"
King
"
(
王
)
.
This
title
does
not
appear
to
have
held
any
practical
meaning
,
or
to
have
given
its
holder
any
power
,
at
Tsongkhapa
's
Ganden
Monastery
.
Wylie
notes
that
this
—
like
the
Karma
Kargyu
—
can
not
be
seen
as
a
reappointment
of
Mongol
Yuan
offices
,
since
the
Gelug
school
was
created
after
the
fall
of
the
Yuan
dynasty
.
Dawa
Norbu
argues
that
modern
Chinese
Communist
historians
tend
to
be
in
favor
of
the
view
that
the
Ming
simply
reappointed
old
Yuan
dynasty
officials
in
Tibet
and
perpetuated
their
rule
of
Tibet
in
this
manner
.
Norbu
writes
that
,
although
this
would
have
been
true
for
the
eastern
Tibetan
regions
of
Amdo
and
Kham
's
"
tribute-cum-trade
"
relations
with
the
Ming
,
it
was
untrue
if
applied
to
the
western
Tibetan
regions
of
Ü-Tsang
and
Ngari
.
After
the
Phagmodrupa
Changchub
Gyaltsen
,
these
were
ruled
by
"
three
successive
nationalistic
regimes
,
"
which
Norbu
writes
"
Communist
historians
prefer
to
ignore
.
"
Laird
writes
that
the
Ming
appointed
titles
to
eastern
Tibetan
princes
,
and
that
"
these
alliances
with
eastern
Tibetan
principalities
are
the
evidence
China
now
produces
for
its
assertion
that
the
Ming
ruled
Tibet
,
"
despite
the
fact
that
the
Ming
did
not
send
an
army
to
replace
the
Mongols
after
they
left
Tibet
.
Yiu
Yung-chin
states
that
the
furthest
western
extent
of
the
Ming
dynasty
's
territory
was
Gansu
,
Sichuan
,
and
Yunnan
while
"
the
Ming
did
not
possess
Tibet
.
"
Shih
-
Shan
Henry
Tsai
writes
that
the
Yongle
Emperor
sent
his
eunuch
Yang
Sanbao
into
Tibet
in
1413
to
gain
the
allegiance
of
various
Tibetan
princes
,
while
the
Yongle
Emperor
paid
a
small
fortune
in
return
gifts
for
tributes
in
order
to
maintain
the
loyalty
of
neighboring
vassal
states
such
as
Nepal
and
Tibet
.
However
,
Van
Praag
states
that
Tibetan
rulers
upheld
their
own
separate
relations
with
the
kingdoms
of
Nepal
and
Kashmir
,
and
at
times
"
engaged
in
armed
confrontation
with
them
.
"
Even
though
the
Gelug
exchanged
gifts
with
and
sent
missions
to
the
Ming
court
up
until
the
1430s
,
the
Gelug
was
not
mentioned
in
the
Mingshi
or
the
Mingshi
Lu
.
On
this
,
historian
Li
Tieh-tseng
says
of
Tsongkhapa
's
refusal
of
Ming
invitations
to
visit
the
Yongle
Emperor
's
court
:
Wylie
asserts
that
this
type
of
censorship
of
the
History
of
Ming
distorts
the
true
picture
of
the
history
of
Sino-Tibetan
relations
,
while
the
Ming
court
granted
titles
to
various
lamas
regardless
of
their
sectarian
affiliations
in
an
ongoing
civil
war
in
Tibet
between
competing
Buddhist
factions
.
Wylie
argues
that
Ming
titles
of
"
King
"
granted
indiscriminately
to
various
Tibetan
lamas
or
even
their
disciples
should
not
be
viewed
as
reappointments
to
earlier
Yuan
dynasty
offices
,
since
the
viceregal
Sakya
regime
established
by
the
Mongols
in
Tibet
was
overthrown
by
the
Phagmodru
myriarchy
before
the
Ming
existed
.
Helmut
Hoffman
states
that
the
Ming
upheld
the
facade
of
rule
over
Tibet
through
periodic
missions
of
"
tribute
emissaries
"
to
the
Ming
court
and
by
granting
nominal
titles
to
ruling
lamas
,
but
did
not
actually
interfere
in
Tibetan
governance
.
Melvyn
C.
Goldstein
writes
that
the
Ming
had
no
real
administrative
authority
over
Tibet
,
as
the
various
titles
given
to
Tibetan
leaders
did
not
confer
authority
as
the
earlier
Mongol
Yuan
titles
had
.
He
asserts
that
"
by
conferring
titles
on
Tibetans
already
in
power
,
the
Ming
emperors
merely
recognized
political
reality
.
"
Hugh
Edward
Richardson
writes
that
the
Ming
dynasty
exercised
no
authority
over
the
succession
of
Tibetan
ruling
families
,
the
Phagmodru
(
1354
–
1435
)
,
Rinpungpa
(
1435
–
1565
)
,
and
Tsangpa
(
1565
–
1642
)
.
In
his
usurpation
of
the
throne
from
the
Jianwen
Emperor
(
r.
1398
–
1402
)
,
the
Yongle

was

by
the
Buddhist
monk
Yao
Guangxiao
,
and
like
his
father
,
the
Hongwu
Emperor
,
the
Yongle
Emperor
was
"
well
-
disposed
towards
Buddhism
"
,
claims
Rossabi
.
On
March
10
,
1403
,
the
Yongle
Emperor
invited
Deshin
Shekpa
,
5th
Karmapa
Lama
(
1384
–
1415
)
,
to
his
court
,
even
though
the
fourth
Karmapa
had
rejected
the
invitation
of
the
Hongwu
Emperor
.
A
Tibetan
translation
in
the
16th
century
preserves
the
letter
of
the
Yongle
Emperor
,
which
the
Association
for
Asian
Studies
notes
is
polite
and
complimentary
towards
the
Karmapa
.
The
letter
of
invitation
reads
,
In
order
to
seek
out
the
Karmapa
,
the
Yongle
Emperor
dispatched
his
eunuch
Hou
Xian
and
the
Buddhist
monk
Zhi
Guang
(
d.
1435
)
to
Tibet
.
Traveling
to
Lhasa
either
through
Qinghai
or
via
the
Silk
Road
to
Khotan
,
Hou
Xian
and
Zhi
Guang
did
not
return
to
Nanjing
until
1407
.
During
his
travels
beginning
in
1403
,
Deshin
Shekpa
was
induced
by
further
exhortations
by
the
Ming
court
to
visit
Nanjing
by
April
10
,
1407
.
Norbu
writes
that
the
Yongle
Emperor
,
following
the
tradition
of
Mongol
emperors
and
their
reverence
for
the
Sakya
lamas
,
showed
an
enormous
amount
of
deference
towards
Deshin
Shekpa
.
The
Yongle
Emperor
came
out
of
the
palace
in
Nanjing
to
greet
the
Karmapa
and
did
not
require
him
to
kowtow
like
a
tributary
vassal
.
According
to
Karma
Thinley
,
the
emperor
gave
the
Karmapa
the
place
of
honor
at
his
left
,
and
on
a
higher
throne
than
his
own
.
Rossabi
and
others
describe
a
similar
arrangement
made
by
Kublai
Khan
and
the
Sakya
Phagpa
lama
,
writing
that
Kublai
would
"
sit
on
a
lower
platform
than
the
Tibetan
cleric
"
when
receiving
religious
instructions
from
him
.
Throughout
the
following
month
,
the
Yongle
Emperor
and
his
court
showered
the
Karmapa
with
presents
.
At
Linggu
Temple
in
Nanjing
,
he
presided
over
the
religious
ceremonies
for
the
Yongle
Emperor
's
deceased
parents
,
while
twenty
-
two
days
of
his
stay
were
marked
by
religious
miracles
that
were
recorded
in
five
languages
on
a
gigantic
scroll
that
bore
the
Emperor
's
seal
.
During
his
stay
in
Nanjing
,
Deshin
Shekpa
was
bestowed
the
title
"
Great
Treasure
Prince
of
Dharma
"
by
the
Yongle
Emperor
.
Elliot
Sperling
asserts
that
the
Yongle
Emperor
,
in
bestowing
Deshin
Shekpa
with
the
title
of
"
King
"
and
praising
his
mystical
abilities
and
miracles
,
was
trying
to
build
an
alliance
with
the
Karmapa
as
the
Mongols
had
with
the
Sakya
lamas
,
but
Deshin
Shekpa
rejected
the
Yongle
Emperor
's
offer
.
In
fact
,
this
was
the
same
title
that
Kublai
Khan
had
offered
the
Sakya
Phagpa
lama
,
but
Deshin
Shekpa
persuaded
the
Yongle
Emperor
to
grant
the
title
to
religious
leaders
of
other
Tibetan
Buddhist
sects
.
Tibetan
sources
say
Deshin
Shekpa
also
persuaded
the
Yongle
Emperor
not
to
impose
his
military
might
on
Tibet
as
the
Mongols
had
previously
done
.
Thinley
writes
that
before
the
Karmapa
returned
to
Tibet
,
the
Yongle
Emperor
began
planning
to
send
a
military
force
into
Tibet
to
forcibly
give
the
Karmapa
authority
over
all
the
Tibetan
Buddhist
schools
but
Deshin
Shekpa
dissuaded
him
.
However
,
Hok
-Lam
Chan
states
that
"
there
is
little
evidence
that
this
was
ever
the
emperor
's
intention
"
and
that
evidence
indicates
that
Deshin
Skekpa
was
invited
strictly
for
religious
purposes
.
Marsha
Weidner
states
that
Deshin
Shekpa
's
miracles
"
testified
to
the
power
of
both
the
emperor
and
his
guru
and
served
as
a
legitimizing
tool
for
the
emperor
's
problematic
succession
to
the
throne
,
"
referring
to
the
Yongle
Emperor
's
conflict
with
the
previous
Jianwen
Emperor
.
Tsai
writes
that
Deshin
Shekpa
aided
the
legitimacy
of
the
Yongle
Emperor
's
rule
by
providing
him
with
portents
and
omens
which
demonstrated
Heaven
's
favor
of
the
Yongle
Emperor
on
the
Ming
throne
.
With
the
example
of
the
Ming
court
's
relationship
with
the
fifth
Karmapa
and
other
Tibetan
leaders
,
Norbu
states
that
Chinese
Communist
historians
have
failed
to
realize
the
significance
of
the
religious
aspect
of
the
Ming-Tibetan
relationship
.
He
writes
that
the
meetings
of
lamas
with
the
Emperor
of
China
were
exchanges
of
tribute
between
"
the
patron
and
the
priest
"
and
were
not
merely
instances
of
a
political
subordinate
paying
tribute
to
a
superior
.
He
also
notes
that
the
items
of
tribute
were
Buddhist
artifacts
which
symbolized
"
the
religious
nature
of
the
relationship
.
"
Josef
Kolmaš
writes
that
the
Ming
dynasty
did
not
exercise
any
direct
political
control
over
Tibet
,
content
with
their
tribute
relations
that
were
"
almost
entirely
of
a
religious
character
.
"
Patricia
Ann
Berger
writes
that
the
Yongle
Emperor
's
courting
and
granting
of
titles
to
lamas
was
his
attempt
to
"
resurrect
the
relationship
between
China
and
Tibet
established
earlier
by
the
Yuan
dynastic
founder
Khubilai
Khan
and
his
guru
Phagpa
.
"
She
also
writes
that
the
later
Qing
emperors
and
their
Mongol
associates
viewed
the
Yongle
Emperor
's
relationship
with
Tibet
as
"
part
of
a
chain
of
reincarnation
that
saw
this
Han
Chinese
emperor
as
yet
another
emanation
of
Manjusri
.
"
The
Information
Office
of
the
State
Council
of
the
PRC
preserves
an
edict
of
the
Zhengtong
Emperor
(
r.
1435
–
1449
)
addressed
to
the
Karmapa
in
1445
,
written
after
the
latter
's
agent
had
brought
holy
relics
to
the
Ming
court
.
Zhengtong
had
the
following
message
delivered
to
the
Great
Treasure
Prince
of
Dharma
,
the
Karmapa
:
Despite
this
glowing
message
by
the
Emperor
,
Chan
writes
that
a
year
later
in
1446
,
the
Ming
court
cut
off
all
relations
with
the
Karmapa
hierarchs
.
Until
then
,
the
court
was
unaware
that
Deshin
Shekpa
had
died
in
1415
.
The
Ming
court
had
believed
that
the
representatives
of
the
Karma
Kagyu
who
continued
to
visit
the
Ming
capital
were
sent
by
the
Karmapa
.
Tsai
writes
that
shortly
after
the
visit
by
Deshin
Shekpa
,
the
Yongle
Emperor
ordered
the
construction
of
a
road
and
of
trading
posts
in
the
upper
reaches
of
the
Yangzi
and
Mekong
Rivers
in
order
to
facilitate
trade
with
Tibet
in
tea
,
horses
,
and
salt
.
The
trade
route
passed
through
Sichuan
and
crossed
Shangri-La
County
in
Yunnan
.
Wang
and
Nyima
assert
that
this
"
tribute-
related
trade
"
of
the
Ming
exchanging
Chinese
tea
for
Tibetan
horses
—
while
granting
Tibetan
envoys
and
Tibetan
merchants
explicit
permission
to
trade
with
Han
Chinese
merchants
—
"
furthered
the
rule
of
the
Ming
dynasty
court
over
Tibet
"
.
Rossabi
and
Sperling
note
that
this
trade
in
Tibetan
horses
for
Chinese
tea
existed
long
before
the
Ming
.
Peter
C.
Perdue
says
that
Wang
Anshi
(
1021
–
1086
)
,
realizing
that
China
could
not
produce
enough
militarily
capable
steeds
,
had
also
aimed
to
obtain
horses
from
Inner
Asia
in
exchange
for
Chinese
tea
.
The
Chinese
needed
horses
not
only
for
cavalry
but
also
as
draft
animals
for
the
army
's
supply
wagons
.
The
Tibetans
required
Chinese
tea
not
only
as
a
common
beverage
but
also
as
a
religious
ceremonial
supplement
.
The
Ming
government
imposed
a
monopoly
on
tea
production
and
attempted
to
regulate
this
trade
with
state
-
supervised
markets
,
but
these
collapsed
in
1449
due
to
military
failures
and
internal
ecological
and
commercial
pressures
on
the
tea-producing
regions
.
Van
Praag
states
that
the
Ming
court
established
diplomatic
delegations
with
Tibet
merely
to
secure
urgently
needed
horses
.
Wang
and
Nyima
argue
that
these
were
not
diplomatic
delegations
at
all
,
that
Tibetan
areas
were
ruled
by
the
Ming
since
Tibetan
leaders
were
granted
positions
as
Ming
officials
,
that
horses
were
collected
from
Tibet
as
a
mandatory
"
corvée
"
tax
,
and
therefore
Tibetans
were
"
undertaking
domestic
affairs
,
not
foreign
diplomacy
"
.
Sperling
writes
that
the
Ming
simultaneously
bought
horses
in
the
Kham
region
while
fighting
Tibetan
tribes
in
Amdo
and
receiving
Tibetan
embassies
in
Nanjing
.
He
also
argues
that
the
embassies
of
Tibetan
lamas
visiting
the
Ming
court
were
for
the
most
part
efforts
to
promote
commercial
transactions
between
the
lamas
'
large
,
wealthy
entourage
and
Ming
Chinese
merchants
and
officials
.
Kolmaš
writes
that
while
the
Ming
maintained
a
laissez-
faire
policy
towards
Tibet
and
limited
the
numbers
of
the
Tibetan
retinues
,
the
Tibetans
sought
to
maintain
a
tributary
relationship
with
the
Ming
because
imperial
patronage
provided
them
with
wealth
and
power
.
Laird
writes
that
Tibetans
eagerly
sought
Ming
court
invitations
since
the
gifts
the
Tibetans
received
for
bringing
tribute
were
much
greater
in
value
than
the
latter
.
As
for
the
Yongle
Emperor
's
gifts
to
his
Tibetan
and
Nepalese
vassals
such
as
silver
wares
,
Buddha
relics
,
utensils
for
Buddhist
temples
and
religious
ceremonies
,
and
gowns
and
robes
for
monks
,
Tsai
writes
"
in
his
effort
to
draw
neighboring
states
to
the
Ming
orbit
so
that
he
could
bask
in
glory
,
the
Yongle
Emperor
was
quite
willing
to
pay
a
small
price
"
.
The
Information
Office
of
the
State
Council
of
the
PRC
lists
the
Tibetan
tribute
items
as
oxen
,
horses
,
camels
,
sheep
,
fur
products
,
medical
herbs
,
Tibetan
incenses
,
thangkas
(
painted
scrolls
)
,
and
handicrafts
;
while
the
Ming
awarded
Tibetan
tribute
-
bearers
an
equal
value
of
gold
,
silver
,
satin
and
brocade
,
bolts
of
cloth
,
grains
,
and
tea
leaves
.
Silk
workshops
during
the
Ming
also
catered
specifically
to
the
Tibetan
market
with
silk
clothes
and
furnishings
featuring
Tibetan
Buddhist
iconography
.
While
the
Ming
dynasty
traded
horses
with
Tibet
,
it
upheld
a
policy
of
outlawing
border
markets
in
the
north
,
which
Laird
sees
as
an
effort
to
punish
the
Mongols
for
their
raids
and
to
"
drive
them
from
the
frontiers
of
China
.
"
However
,
after
Altan
Khan
(
1507
–
1582
)
—
leader
of
the
Tümed
Mongols
who
overthrew
the
Oirat
Mongol
confederation
's
hegemony
over
the
steppes
—
made
peace
with
the
Ming
dynasty
in
1571
,
he
persuaded
the
Ming
to
reopen
their
border
markets
in
1573
.
This
provided
the
Chinese
with
a
new
supply
of
horses
that
the
Mongols
had
in
excess
;
it
was
also
a
relief
to
the
Ming
,
since
they
were
unable
to
stop
the
Mongols
from
periodic
raiding
.
Laird
says
that
despite
the
fact
that
later
Mongols
believed
Altan
forced
the
Ming
to
view
him
as
an
equal
,
Chinese
historians
argue
that
he
was
simply
a
loyal
Chinese
citizen
.
By
1578
,
Altan
Khan
formed
a
formidable
Mongol-Tibetan
alliance
with
the
Gelug
that
the
Ming
viewed
from
afar
without
intervention
.
Patricia
Ebrey
writes
that
Tibet
,
like
Joseon
Korea
and
other
neighboring
states
to
the
Ming
,
settled
for
its
tributary
status
while
there
were
no
troops
or
governors
of
Ming
China
stationed
in
its
territory
.
Laird
writes
that
"
after
the
Mongol
troops
left
Tibet
,
no
Ming
troops
replaced
them
.
"
Wang
and
Nyima
state
that
,
despite
the
fact
that
the
Ming
refrained
from
sending
troops
to
subdue
Tibet
and
refrained
from
garrisoning
Ming
troops
there
,
these
measures
were
unnecessary
so
long
as
the
Ming
court
upheld
close
ties
with
Tibetan
vassals
and
their
forces
.
However
,
there
were
instances
in
the
14th
century
when
the
Hongwu
Emperor
did
use
military
force
to
quell
unrest
in
Tibet
.
John
D.
Langlois
writes
that
there
was
unrest
in
Tibet
and
western
Sichuan
,
which
the
Marquis
Mu
Ying
(
沐英
)
was
commissioned
to
quell
in
November
1378
after
he
established
a
Taozhou
garrison
in
Gansu
.
Langlois
notes
that
by
October
1379
,
Mu
Ying
had
allegedly
captured
30,000
Tibetan
prisoners
and
200,000
domesticated
animals
.
Yet
invasion
went
both
ways
;
the
Ming
general
Qu
Neng
,
under
the
command
of
Lan
Yu
,
was
ordered
to
repel
a
Tibetan
assault
into
Sichuan
in
1390
.
Discussions
of
strategy
in
the
mid
Ming
dynasty
focused
primarily
on
recovery
of
the
Ordos
region
,
which
the
Mongols
used
as
a
rallying
base
to
stage
raids
into
Ming
China
.
Norbu
states
that
the
Ming
dynasty
,
preoccupied
with
the
Mongol
threat
to
the
north
,
could
not
spare
additional
armed
forces
to
enforce
or
back
up
their
claim
of
sovereignty
over
Tibet
;
instead
,
they
relied
on
"
Confucian
instruments
of
tribute
relations
"
of
heaping
unlimited
number
of
titles
and
gifts
on
Tibetan
lamas
through
acts
of
diplomacy
.
Sperling
states
that
the
delicate
relationship
between
the
Ming
and
Tibet
was
"
the
last
time
a
united
China
had
to
deal
with
an
independent
Tibet
,
"
that
there
was
a
potential
for
armed
conflict
at
their
borders
,
and
that
the
ultimate
goal
of
Ming
foreign
policy
with
Tibet
was
not
subjugation
but
"
avoidance
of
any
kind
of
Tibetan
threat
.
"
P.
Christiaan
Klieger
argues
that
the
Ming
court
's
patronage
of
high
Tibetan
lamas
"
was
designed
to
help
stabilize
border
regions
and
protect
trade
routes
.
"
Historians
Luciano
Petech
and
Sato
Hisashi
argue
that
the
Ming
upheld
a
"
divide-and-
rule
"
policy
towards
a
weak
and
politically
fragmented
Tibet
after
the
Sakya
regime
had
fallen
.
Chan
writes
that
this
was
perhaps
the
calculated
strategy
of
the
Yongle
Emperor
,
as
exclusive
patronage
to
one
Tibetan
sect
would
have
given
it
too
much
regional
power
.
Sperling
finds
no
textual
evidence
in
either
Chinese
or
Tibetan
sources
to
support
this
thesis
of
Petech
and
Hisashi
.
Norbu
asserts
that
their
thesis
is
largely
based
on
the
list
of
Ming
titles
conferred
on
Tibetan
lamas
rather
than
"
comparative
analysis
of
developments
in
China
and
Tibet
.
"
Rossabi
states
that
this
theory
"
attributes
too
much
influence
to
the
Chinese
,
"
pointing
out
that
Tibet
was
already
politically
divided
when
the
Ming
dynasty
began
.
Rossabi
also
discounts
the
"
divide-and-
rule
"
theory
on
the
grounds
of
the
Yongle
Emperor
's
failed
attempt
to
build
a
strong
relationship
with
the
fifth
Karmapa
—
one
which
he
hoped
would
parallel
Kublai
Khan
's
earlier
relationship
with
the
Sakya
Phagpa
lama
.
Instead
,
the
Yongle
Emperor
followed
the
Karmapa
's
advice
of
giving
patronage
to
many
different
Tibetan
lamas
.
The
Association
for
Asian
Studies
states
that
there
is
no
known
written
evidence
to
suggest
that
later
leaders
of
the
Gelug
—
Gendün
Drup
(
1391
–
1474
)
and
Gendün
Gyatso
(
1475
–
1571
)
—
had
any
contacts
with
Ming
China
.
These
two
religious
leaders
were
preoccupied
with
an
overriding
concern
for
dealing
with
the
powerful
secular
Rinpungpa
princes
,
who
were
patrons
and
protectors
of
the
Karma
Kargyu
lamas
.
The
Rinpungpa
leaders
were
relatives
of
the
Phagmodrupa
,
yet
their
authority
shifted
over
time
from
simple
governors
to
rulers
in
their
own
right
over
large
areas
of
Ü-Tsang
.
The
prince
of
Rinbung
occupied
Lhasa
in
1498
and
excluded
the
Gelug
from
attending
New
Years
ceremonies
and
prayers
,
the
most
important
event
in
the
Gelug
.
While
the
task
of
New
Years
prayers
in
Lhasa
was
granted
to
the
Karmapa
and
others
,
Gendün
Gyatso
traveled
in
exile
looking
for
allies
.
However
,
it
was
not
until
1518
that
the
secular
Phagmodru
ruler
captured
Lhasa
from
the
Rinbung
,
and
thereafter
the
Gelug
was
given
rights
to
conduct
the
New
Years
prayer
.
When
the
Drikung
Kagyu
abbot
of
Drigung
Monastery
threatened
Lhasa
in
1537
,
Gendün
Gyatso
was
forced
to
abandon
the
Drepung
Monastery
,
although
he
eventually
returned
.
The
Zhengde
Emperor
(
r.
1505
–
1521
)
,
who
enjoyed
the
company
of
lamas
at
court
despite
protests
from
the
censorate
,
had
heard
tales
of
a
"
living
Buddha
"
which
he
desired
to
host
at
the
Ming
capital
;
this
was
none
other
than
the
Rinpung-supported
Mikyö
Dorje
,
8th
Karmapa
Lama
then
occupying
Lhasa
.
Zhengde
's
top
advisors
made
every
attempt
to
dissuade
him
from
inviting
this
lama
to
court
,
arguing
that
Tibetan
Buddhism
was
wildly
heterodox
and
unorthodox
.
Despite
protests
by
the
Grand
Secretary
Liang
Chu
,
in
1515
the
Zhengde
Emperor
sent
his
eunuch
official
Liu
Yun
of
the
Palace
Chancellery
on
a
mission
to
invite
this
Karmapa
to
Beijing
.
Liu
commanded
a
fleet
of
hundreds
of
ships
requisitioned
along
the
Yangtze
,
consuming
2,835
g
(
100
oz
)
of
silver
a
day
in
food
expenses
while
stationed
for
a
year
in
Chengdu
of
Sichuan
.
After
procurring
necessary
gifts
for
the
mission
,
he
departed
with
a
cavalry
force
of
about
1,000
troops
.
When
the
request
was
delivered
,
the
Karmapa
lama
refused
to
leave
Tibet
despite
the
Ming
force
brought
to
coerce
him
.
The
Karmapa
launched
a
surprise
ambush
on
Liu
Yun
's
camp
,
seizing
all
the
goods
and
valuables
while
killing
or
wounding
half
of
Liu
Yun
's
entire
escort
.
After
this
fiasco
,
Liu
fled
for
his
life
,
but
only
returned
to
Chengdu
several
years
later
to
find
that
the
Zhengde
Emperor
had
died
.
Elliot
Sperling
,
a
specialist
of
Indian
studies
and
the
director
of
the
Tibetan
Studies
program
at
Indiana
University
’s
Department
of
Central
Eurasia
Studies
,
writes
that
"
the
idea
that
Tibet
became
part
of
China
in
the
13th
century
is
a
very
recent
construction
.
"
He
writes
that
Chinese
writers
of
the
early
20th
century
were
of
the
view
that
Tibet
was
not
annexed
by
China
until
the
Manchu
Qing
dynasty
invasion
during
the
18th
century
.
He
also
states
that
Chinese
writers
of
the
early
20th
century
described
Tibet
as
a
feudal
dependency
of
China
,
not
an
integral
part
of
it
.
Sperling
states
that
this
is
because
"
Tibet
was
ruled
as
such
,
within
the
empires
of
the
Mongols
and
the
Manchus
"
and
also
that
"
China
's
intervening
Ming
dynasty
...
had
no
control
over
Tibet
.
"
He
writes
that
the
Ming
relationship
with
Tibet
is
problematic
for
China
’s
insistence
of
its
unbroken
sovereignty
over
Tibet
since
the
13th
century
.
As
for
the
Tibetan
view
that
Tibet
was
never
subject
to
the
rule
of
the
Yuan
or
Qing
emperors
of
China
,
Sperling
also
discounts
this
by
stating
that
Tibet
was
"
subject
to
rules
,
laws
and
decisions
made
by
the
Yuan
and
Qing
rulers
"
and
that
even
Tibetans
described
themselves
as
subjects
of
these
emperors
.
Josef
Kolmaš
,
a
sinologist
,
Tibetologist
,
and
Professor
of
Oriental
Studies
at
the
Academy
of
Sciences
of
the
Czech
Republic
,
writes
that
it
was
during
the
Qing
dynasty
"
that
developments
took
place
on
the
basis
of
which
Tibet
came
to
be
considered
an
organic
part
of
China
,
both
practically
and
theoretically
subject
to
the
Chinese
central
government
.
"
Yet
he
states
that
this
was
a
radical
change
in
regards
to
all
previous
eras
of
Sino-Tibetan
relations
.
P.
Christiaan
Klieger
,
an
anthropologist
and
scholar
of
the
California
Academy
of
Sciences
in
San
Francisco
,
writes
that
the
vice
royalty
of
the
Sakya
regime
installed
by
the
Mongols
established
a
patron
and
priest
relationship
between
Tibetans
and
Mongol
converts
to
Tibetan
Buddhism
.
According
to
him
,
the
Tibetan
lamas
and
Mongol
khans
upheld
a
"
mutual
role
of
religious
prelate
and
secular
patron
,
"
respectively
.
He
adds
that
"
Although
agreements
were
made
between
Tibetan
leaders
and
Mongol
khans
,
Ming
and
Qing
emperors
,
it
was
the
Republic
of
China
and
its
Communist
successors
that
assumed
the
former
imperial
tributaries
and
subject
states
as
integral
parts
of

.
"
China
Daily
,
a
CCP
-
controlled
news
organization
since
1981
,
states
in
a
2008
article
that
although
there
were
dynastic
changes
after
Tibet
was
incorporated
into
the
territory
of
Yuan
dynasty
's
China
in
the
13th
century
,
"
Tibet
has
remained
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
central
government
of
China
.
"
It
also
states
that
the
Ming
dynasty
"
inherited
the
right
to
rule
Tibet
"
from
the
Yuan
dynasty
,
and
repeats
the
claims
in
the
Mingshi
about
the
Ming
establishing
two
itinerant
high
commands
over
Tibet
.
China
Daily
states
that
the
Ming
handled
Tibet
's
civil
administration
,
appointed
all
leading
officials
of
these
administrative
organs
,
and
punished
Tibetans
who
broke
the
law
.
The

Daily
,
the
state-controlled
Xinhua
News
Agency
,
and
the
state-controlled
national
television
network
China
Central
Television
posted
the
same
article
that
China
Daily
had
,
the
only
difference
being
their
headlines
and
some
additional
text
.
During
the
reign
of
the
Jiajing
Emperor
(
r.
1521
–
1567
)
,
the
native
Chinese
ideology
of
Daoism
was
fully
sponsored
at
the
Ming
court
,
while
Tibetan
Vajrayana
and
even
Chinese
Buddhism
were
ignored
or
suppressed
.
Even
the
History
of
Ming
states
that
the
Tibetan
lamas
discontinued
their
trips
to
Ming
China
and
its
court
at
this
point
.
Grand
Secretary
Yang
Tinghe
under
Jiajing
was
determined
to
break
the
eunuch
influence
at
court
which
typified
the
Zhengde
era
,
an
example
being
the
costly
escort
of
the
eunuch
Liu
Yun
as
described
above
in
his
failed
mission
to
Tibet
.
The
court
eunuchs
were
in
favor
of
expanding
and
building
new
commercial
ties
with
foreign
countries
such
as
Portugal
,
which
Zhengde
deemed
permissible
since
he
had
an
affinity
for
foreign
and
exotic
people
.
With
the
death
of
Zhengde
and
ascension
of
Jiajing
,
the
politics
at
court
shifted
in
favor
of
the
Neo-Confucian
establishment
which
not
only
rejected
the
Portuguese
embassy
of
Fernão
Pires
de
Andrade
(
d.
1523
)
,
but
had
a
predisposed
animosity
towards
Tibetan
Buddhism
and
lamas
.
Evelyn
S.
Rawski
,
a
professor
in
the
Department
of
History
of
the
University
of
Pittsburgh
,
writes
that
the
Ming
's
unique
relationship
with
Tibetan
prelates
essentially
ended
with
Jiajing
's
reign
while
Ming
influence
in
the
Amdo
region
was
supplanted
by
the
Mongols
.
Meanwhile
,
the
Tumed
Mongols
began
moving
into
the
Kokonor
region
(
modern
Qinghai
)
,
raiding
the
Ming
Chinese
frontier
and
even
as
far
as
the
suburbs
of
Beijing
under
Altan
Khan
(
1507
–
1582
)
.
Klieger
writes
that
Altan
Khan
's
presence
in
the
west
effectively
reduced
Ming
influence
and
contact
with
Tibet
.
After
Altan
Khan
made
peace
with
the
Ming
dynasty
in
1571
,
he
invited
the
third
hierarch
of
the
Gelug
—
Sönam
Gyatso
(
1543
–
1588
)
—
to
meet
him
in
Amdo
(
modern
Qinghai
)
in
1578
,
where
he
accidentally
bestowed
him
and
his
two
predecessors
with
the
title
of
Dalai
Lama
—
"
Ocean
Teacher
"
.
The
full
title
was
"
Dalai
Lama
Vajradhara
"
,
"
Vajradhara
"
meaning
"
Holder
of
the
Thunderbolt
"
in
Sanskrit
.
Victoria
Huckenpahler
notes
that
Vajradhara
is
considered
by
Buddhists
to
be
the
primordial
Buddha
of
limitless
and
all-
pervasive
beneficial
qualities
,
a
being
that
"
represents
the
ultimate
aspect
of
enlightenment
.
"
Goldstein
writes
that
Sönam
Gyatso
also
enhanced
Altan
Khan
's
standing
by
granting
him
the
title
"
king
of
religion
,
majestic
purity
"
.
Rawski
writes
that
the
Dalai
Lama
officially
recognized
Altan
Khan
as
the
"
Protector
of
the
Faith
"
.
Laird
writes
that
Altan
Khan
abolished
the
native
Mongol
practices
of
shamanism
and
blood
sacrifice
,
while
the
Mongol
princes
and
subjects
were
coerced
by
Altan
to
convert
to
Gelug
Buddhism
—
or
face
execution
if
they
persisted
in
their
shamanistic
ways
.
Committed
to
their
religious
leader
,
Mongol
princes
began
requesting
the
Dalai
Lama
to
bestow
titles
on
them
,
which
demonstrated
"
the
unique
fusion
of
religious
and
political
power
"
wielded
by
the
Dalai
Lama
,
as
Laird
writes
.
Kolmaš
states
that
the
spiritual
and
secular
Mongol-Tibetan
alliance
of
the
13th
century
was
renewed
by
this
alliance
constructed
by
Altan
Khan
and
Sönam
Gyatso
.
Van
Praag
writes
that
this
restored
the
original
Mongol
patronage
of
a
Tibetan
lama
and
"
to
this
day
,
Mongolians
are
among
the
most
devout
followers
of
the
Gelugpa
and
the
Dalai
Lama
.
"
Angela
F.
Howard
writes
that
this
unique
relationship
not
only
provided
the
Dalai
Lama
and
Panchen
Lama
with
religious
and
political
authority
in
Tibet
,
but
that
Altan
Khan
gained
"
enormous
power
among
the
entire
Mongol
population
.
"
Rawski
writes
that
Altan
Khan
's
conversion
to
the
Gelug
"
can
be
interpreted
as
an
attempt
to
expand
his
authority
in
his
conflict
with
his
nominal
superior
,
Tümen
Khan
.
"
To
further
cement
the
Mongol-Tibetan
alliance
,
the
great-grandson
of
Altan
Khan
—
the
4th
Dalai
Lama
(
1589
–
1616
)
—
was
made
the
fourth
Dalai
Lama
.
In
1642
,
the
5th
Dalai
Lama
(
1617
–
1682
)
became
the
first
to
wield
effective
political
control
over
Tibet
.
Sonam
Gyatso
,
after
being
granted
the
grandiose
title
by
Altan
Khan
,
departed
for
Tibet
.
Before
he
left
,
he
sent
a
letter
and
gifts
to
the
Ming
Chinese
official
Zhang
Juzheng
(
1525
–
1582
)
,
which
arrived
on
March
12
,
1579
.
Sometime
in
August
or
September
of
that
year
,
Sonam
Gyatso
's
representative
stationed
with
Altan
Khan
received
a
return
letter
and
gift
from
the
Wanli
Emperor
(
r.
1572
–
1620
)
,
who
also
conferred
upon
Sonam
Gyatso
a
title
;
this
was
the
first
official
contact
between
a
Dalai
Lama
and
a
government
of
China
.
However
,
Laird
states
that
when
Wanli
invited
him
to
Beijing
,
the
Dalai
Lama
declined
the
offer
due
to
a
prior
commitment
,
even
though
he
was
only
400
km
(
250
mi
)
from
Beijing
.
Laird
adds
that
"
the
power
of
the
Ming
emperor
did
not
reach
very
far
at
the
time
.
"
Although
not
recorded
in
any
official
Chinese
records
,
Sonam
Gyatso
's
biography
states
that
Wanli
again
conferred
titles
on
Sonam
Gyatso
in
1588
,
and
invited
him
to
Beijing
for
a
second
time
,
but
Sonam
Gyatso
was
unable
to
visit
China
as
he
died
the
same
year
in
Mongolia
working
with
Altan
Khan
's
son
to
further
the
spread
of
Buddhism
.
Of
the
third
Dalai
Lama
,
China
Daily
states
that
the
"
Ming
dynasty
showed
him
special
favor
by
allowing
him
to
pay
tribute
.
"
China
Daily
then
says
that
Sonam
Gyatso
was
granted
the
title
Dorjichang
or
Vajradhara
Dalai
Lama
in
1587
[
sic
!
]
,
but
China
Daily
does
not
mention
who
granted
him
the
title
.
Without
mentioning
the
role
of
the
Mongols
,
China
Daily
states
that
it
was
the
successive
Qing
dynasty
which
established
the
title
of
Dalai
Lama
and
his
power
in
Tibet
:
"
In
1653
,
the
Qing
emperor
granted
an
honorific
title
to
the
fifth
Dalai
Lama
and
then
did
the
same
for
the
fifth
Panchen
Lama
in
1713
,
officially
establishing
the
titles
of
the
Dalai
Lama
and
the
Panchen
Erdeni
,
and
their
political
and
religious
status
in
Tibet
.
"
Chen
states
that
the
fourth
Dalai
Lama
Yonten
Gyatso
was
granted
the
title
"
Master
of
Vajradhara
"
and
an
official
seal
by
the
Wanli
Emperor
in
1616
.
This
was
noted
in
the
Biography
of
the
Fourth
Dalai
Lama
,
which
stated
that
one
Soinam
Lozui
delivered
the
seal
of
the
Emperor
to
the
Dalai
Lama
.
The
Wanli
Emperor
had
invited
Yonten
Gyatso
to
Beijing
in
1616
,
but
just
like
his
predecessor
he
died
before
being
able
to
make
the
journey
.
Kolmaš
writes
that
,
as
the
Mongol
presence
in
Tibet
increased
,
culminating
in
the
conquest
of
Tibet
by
a
Mongol
leader
in
1642
,
the
Ming
emperors
"
viewed
with
apparent
unconcern
these
developments
in
Tibet
.
"
He
adds
that
the
Ming
court
's
lack
of
concern
for
Tibet
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
Mongols
pounced
on
the
chance
to
reclaim
their
old
vassal
of
Tibet
and
"
fill
once
more
the
political
vacuum
in
that
country
.
"
On
the
mass
Mongol
conversion
to
Tibetan
Buddhism
under
Altan
Khan
,
Laird
writes
that
"
the
Chinese
watched
these
developments
with
interest
,
though
few
Chinese
ever
became
devout
Tibetan
Buddhists
.
"
In
1565
,
the
powerful
Rinbung
princes
were
overthrown
by
one
of
their
own
ministers
,
Karma
Tseten
who
styled
himself
as
the
Tsangpa
,
"
the
one
of
Tsang
"
,
and
established
his
base
of
power
at
Shigatse
.
The
second
successor
of
this
first
Tsang
king
,
Karma
Phuntsok
Namgyal
,
took
control
of
the
whole
of
Central
Tibet
(
Ü-
Tsang
)
,
reigning
from
1611
–
1621
.
Despite
this
,
the
leaders
of
Lhasa
still
claimed
their
allegiance
to
the
Phagmodru
as
well
as
the
Gelug
,
while
the
Ü-Tsang
king
allied
with
the
Karmapa
.
Tensions
rose
between
the
nationalistic
Ü-Tsang
ruler
and
the
Mongols
who
safeguarded
their
Mongol
Dalai
Lama
in
Lhasa
.
The
fourth
Dalai
Lama
refused
to
give
an
audience
to
the
Ü-Tsang
king
,
which
sparked
a
conflict
as
the
latter
began
assaulting
Gelug
monasteries
.
Chen
writes
of
the
speculation
over
the
fourth
Dalai
Lama
's
mysterious
death
and
the
plot
of
the
Ü-
Tsang
king
to
have
him
murdered
for
"
cursing
"
him
with
illness
,
although
Chen
writes
that
the
murder
was
most
likely
the
result
of
a
feudal
power
struggle
.
In
1618
,
only
two
years
after
Yonten
Gyatso
died
,
the
Gelug
and
the
Karma
Kargyu
went
to
war
,
the
Karma
Kargyu
supported
by
the
secular
Ü-Tsang
king
.
The
Ü-Tsang
ruler
had
a
large
number
of
Gelugpa
lamas
killed
,
occupied
their
monasteries
at
Drepung
and
Sera
,
and
outlawed
any
attempts
to
find
another
Dalai
Lama
.
In
1621
,
the
Ü-
Tsang
king
died
and
was
succeeded
by
his
young
son
Karma
Tenkyong
,
an
event
which
stymied
the
war
effort
as
the
latter
accepted
the
six-year
-
old
Lozang
Gyatso
as
the
new
Dalai
Lama
.
Despite
the
new
Dalai
Lama
's
diplomatic
efforts
to
maintain
friendly
relations
with
the
new
Ü-Tsang
ruler
,
Sonam
Rapten
(
1595
–
1657
)
,
the
Dalai
Lama
's
chief
steward
and
treasurer
at
Drepung
,
made
efforts
to
overthrow
the
Ü-Tsang
king
,
which
led
to
another
conflict
.
In
1633
,
the
Gelugpas
and
several
thousand
Mongol
adherents
defeated
the
Ü-Tsang
king
's
troops
near
Lhasa
before
a
peaceful
negotiation
was
settled
.
Goldstein
writes
that
in
this
the
"
Mongols
were
again
playing
a
significant
role
in
Tibetan
affairs
,
this
time
as
the
military
arm
of
the
Dalai
Lama
.
"
When
an
ally
of
the
Ü-Tsang
ruler
threatened
destruction
of
the
Gelugpas
again
,
the
fifth
Dalai
Lama
Lozang
Gyatso
pleaded
for
help
from
the
Mongol
prince
Güshi
Khan
(
1582
–
1655
)
,
leader
of
the
Khoshut
(
Qoshot
)
tribe
of
the
Oirat
Mongols
,
who
was
then
on
a
pilgrimage
to
Lhasa
.
Güshi
Khan
accepted
his
role
as
protector
,
and
from
1637
–
1640
he
not
only
defeated
the
Gelugpas
'
enemies
in
the
Amdo
and
Kham
regions
,
but
also
resettled
his
entire
tribe
into
Amdo
.
Sonam
Chöpel
urged
Güshi
Khan
to
assault
the
Ü-Tsang
king
's
homebase
of
Shigatse
,
which
Güshi
Khan
agreed
upon
,
enlisting
the
aid
of
Gelug
monks
and
supporters
.
In
1642
,
after
a
year
's
siege
of
Shigatse
,
the
Ü-Tsang
forces
surrendered
.
Güshi
Khan
then
captured
and
summarily
executed
Karma
Tenkyong
,
the
ruler
of
Ü-Tsang
,
King
of
Tibet
.
Soon
after
the
victory
in
Ü-Tsang
,
Güshi
Khan
organized
a
welcoming
ceremony
for
Lozang
Gyatso
once
he
arrived
a
day
's
ride
from
Shigatse
,
presenting
his
conquest
of
Tibet
as
a
gift
to
the
Dalai
Lama
.
In
a
second
ceremony
held
within
the
main
hall
of
the
Shigatse
fortress
,
Güshi
Khan
enthroned
the
Dalai
Lama
as
the
ruler
of
Tibet
,
but
conferred
the
actual
governing
authority
to
the
regent
Sonam
Chöpel
.
Although
Güshi
Khan
had
granted
the
Dalai
Lama
"
supreme
authority
"
as
Goldstein
writes
,
the
title
of
'
King
of
Tibet
'
was
conferred
upon
Güshi
Khan
,
spending
his
summers
in
pastures
north
of
Lhasa
and
occupying
Lhasa
each
winter
.
Van
Praag
writes
that
at
this
point
Güshi
Khan
maintained
control
over
the
armed
forces
,
but
accepted
his
inferior
status
towards
the
Dalai
Lama
.
Rawski
writes
that
the
Dalai
Lama
shared
power
with
his
regent
and
Güshi
Khan
during
his
early
secular
and
religious
reign
.
However
,
Rawski
states
that
he
eventually
"
expanded
his
own
authority
by
presenting
himself
as
Avalokiteśvara
through
the
performance
of
rituals
,
"
by
building
the
Potala
Palace
and
other
structures
on
traditional
religious
sites
,
and
by
emphasizing
lineage
reincarnation
through
written
biographies
.
Goldstein
states
that
the
government
of
Güshi
Khan
and
the
Dalai
Lama
persecuted
the
Karma
Kagyu
sect
,
confiscated
their
wealth
and
property
,
and
even
converted
their
monasteries
into
Gelug
monasteries
.
Rawski
writes
that
this
Mongol
patronage
allowed
the
Gelugpas
to
dominate
the
rival
religious
sects
in
Tibet
.
Meanwhile
,
the
Chinese
Ming
dynasty
fell
to
the
rebellion
of
Li
Zicheng
(
1606
–
1645
)
in
1644
,
yet
his
short-
lived
Shun
dynasty
was
crushed
by
the
Manchu
invasion
and
the
Han
Chinese
general
Wu
Sangui
(
1612
–
1678
)
.
China
Daily
states
that
when
the
following
Qing
dynasty
replaced
the
Ming
dynasty
,
it
merely
"
strengthened
administration
of
Tibet
.
"
However
,
Kolmaš
states
that
the
Dalai
Lama
was
very
observant
of
what
was
going
on
in
China
and
accepted
a
Manchu
invitation
in
1640
to
send
envoys
to
their
capital
at
Mukden
in
1642
,
before
the
Ming
collapsed
.
Dawa
Norbu
,
William
Rockhill
,
and
George
N.
Patterson
write
that
when
the
Shunzhi
Emperor
(
r.
1644
–
1661
)
of
the
subsequent
Qing
dynasty
invited
the
fifth
Dalai
Lama
Lozang
Gyatso
to
Beijing
in
1652
,
Shunzhi
treated
the
Dalai
Lama
as
an
independent
sovereign
of
Tibet
.
Patterson
writes
that
this
was
an
effort
of
Shunzhi
to
secure
an
alliance
with
Tibet
that
would
ultimately
lead
to
the
establishment
of
Manchu
rule
over
Mongolia
.
In
this
meeting
with
the
Qing
emperor
,
Goldstein
asserts
that
the
Dalai
Lama
was
not
someone
to
be
trifled
with
due
to
his
alliance
with
Mongol
tribes
,
some
of
which
were
declared
enemies
of
the
Qing
.
Van
Praag
states
that
Tibet
and
the
Dalai
Lama
's
power
was
recognized
by
the
"
Manchu
Emperor
,
the
Mongolian
Khans
and
Princes
,
and
the
rulers
of
Ladakh
,
Nepal
,
India
,
Bhutan
,
and
Sikkim
.
"
When
the
Dzungar
Mongols
attempted
to
spread
their
territory
from
what
is
now
Xinjiang
into
Tibet
,
the
Kangxi
Emperor
(
r.
1661
–
1722
)
responded
to
Tibetan
pleas
for
aid
with
his
own
expedition
to
Tibet
,
occupying
Lhasa
in
1720
.
By
1751
,
during
the
reign
of
the
Qianlong
Emperor
(
r.
1735
–
1796
)
,
a
protectorate
and
permanent
Qing
dynasty
garrison
was
established
in
Tibet
.
As
of
1751
,
Albert
Kolb
writes
that
"
Chinese
claims
to
suzerainty
over
Tibet
date
from
this
time
.

Alexander
Graham
Bell
(
March
3
,
1847
–
August
2
,
1922
)
was
a
Scottish-
born
[
N
3
]
scientist
,
inventor
,
engineer
and
innovator
who
is
credited
with
patenting
the
first
practical
telephone
.
Bell
's
father
,
grandfather
,
and
brother
had
all
been
associated
with
work
on
elocution
and
speech
,
and
both
his
mother
and
wife
were
deaf
,
profoundly
influencing
Bell
's
life
's
work
.
His
research
on
hearing
and
speech
further
led
him
to
experiment
with
hearing
devices
which
eventually
culminated
in
Bell
being
awarded
the
first
U.S.
patent
for
the
telephone
in
1876
.
[
N

]
Bell
considered
his
most
famous
invention
an
intrusion
on
his
real
work
as
a
scientist
and
refused
to
have
a
telephone
in
his
study
.
[
N

]
Many
other
inventions
marked
Bell
's
later
life
,
including
groundbreaking
work
in
optical
telecommunications
,
hydrofoils
and
aeronautics
.
Although
Bell
was
not
one
of
the
33
founders
of
the
National
Geographic
Society
,
he
had
a
strong
influence
on
the
magazine
while
serving
as
the
second
president
from
January
7
,
1898
until
1903
.
Alexander
Bell
was
born
in
Edinburgh
,
Scotland
,
on
March
3
,
1847
.
The
family
home
was
at
16
South
Charlotte
Street
,
and
has
a
stone
inscription
marking
it
as
Alexander
Graham
Bell
's
birthplace
.
He
had
two
brothers
:
Melville
James
Bell
(
1845–70
)
and
Edward
Charles
Bell
(
1848–67
)
,
both
of
whom
would
die
of
tuberculosis
.
His
father
was
Professor
Alexander
Melville
Bell
,
a
phonetician
,
and
his
mother
was
Eliza
Grace
(
née
Symonds
)
.
Born
as
just
"
Alexander
Bell
"
,
at
age
10
he
made
a
plea
to
his
father
to
have
a
middle
name
like
his
two
brothers
.
[
N

]
For
his
11th
birthday
,
his
father
acquiesced
and
allowed
him
to
adopt
the
name
"
Graham
"
,
chosen
out
of
respect
for
Alexander
Graham
,
a
Canadian
being
treated
by
his
father
who
had
become
a
family
friend
.
To
close
relatives
and
friends
he
remained
"
Aleck
"
.
As
a
child
,
young
Bell
displayed
a
natural
curiosity
about
his
world
,
resulting
in
gathering
botanical
specimens
as
well
as
experimenting
even
at
an
early
age
.
His
best
friend
was
Ben
Herdman
,
a
neighbor
whose
family
operated
a
flour
mill
,
the
scene
of
many
forays
.
Young
Bell
asked
what
needed
to
be
done
at
the
mill
.
He
was
told
wheat
had
to
be
dehusked
through
a
laborious
process
and
at
the
age
of
12
,
Bell
built
a
homemade
device
that
combined
rotating
paddles
with
sets
of
nail
brushes
,
creating
a
simple
dehusking
machine
that
was
put
into
operation
and
used
steadily
for
a
number
of
years
.
In
return
,
John
Herdman
gave
both
boys
the
run
of
a
small
workshop
in
which
to
"
invent
"
.
From
his
early
years
,
Bell
showed
a
sensitive
nature
and
a
talent
for
art
,
poetry
,
and
music
that
was
encouraged
by
his
mother
.
With
no
formal
training
,
he
mastered
the
piano
and
became
the
family
's
pianist
.
Despite
being
normally
quiet
and
introspective
,
he
reveled
in
mimicry
and
"
voice
tricks
"
akin
to
ventriloquism
that
continually
entertained
family
guests
during
their
occasional
visits
.
Bell
was
also
deeply
affected
by
his
mother
's
gradual
deafness
,
(
she
began
to
lose
her
hearing
when
he
was
12
)
and
learned
a
manual
finger
language
so
he
could
sit
at
her
side
and
tap
out
silently
the
conversations
swirling
around
the
family
parlour
.
He
also
developed
a
technique
of
speaking
in
clear
,
modulated
tones
directly
into
his
mother
's
forehead
wherein
she
would
hear
him
with
reasonable
clarity
.
Bell
's
preoccupation
with
his
mother
's
deafness
led
him
to
study
acoustics
.
His
family
was
long
associated
with
the
teaching
of
elocution
:
his
grandfather
,
Alexander
Bell
,
in
London
,
his
uncle
in
Dublin
,
and
his
father
,
in
Edinburgh
,
were
all
elocutionists
.
His
father
published
a
variety
of
works
on
the
subject
,
several
of
which
are
still
well
known
,
especially
his
The
Standard
Elocutionist
(
1860
)
,
which
appeared
in
Edinburgh
in
1868
.
The
Standard
Elocutionist
appeared
in
168
British
editions
and
sold
over
a
quarter
of
a
million
copies
in
the
United
States
alone
.
In
this
treatise
,
his
father
explains
his
methods
of
how
to
instruct
deaf-mutes
(
as
they
were
then
known
)
to
articulate
words
and
read
other
people
's
lip
movements
to
decipher
meaning
.
Bell
's
father
taught
him
and
his
brothers
not
only
to
write
Visible
Speech
but
to
identify
any
symbol
and
its
accompanying
sound
.
Bell
became
so
proficient
that
he
became
a
part
of
his
father
's
public
demonstrations
and
astounded
audiences
with
his
abilities
.
He
could
decipher
Visible
Speech
representing
virtually
every
language
,
including
Latin
,
Scottish
Gaelic
,
and
even
Sanskrit
,
accurately
reciting
written
tracts
without
any
prior
knowledge
of
their
pronunciation
.
As
a
young
child
,
Bell
,
like
his
brothers
,
received
his
early
schooling
at
home
from
his
father
.
At
an
early
age
,
however
,
he
was
enrolled
at
the
Royal
High
School
,
Edinburgh
,
Scotland
,
which
he
left
at
age
15
,
completing
only
the
first
four
forms
.
His
school
record
was
undistinguished
,
marked
by
absenteeism
and
lacklustre
grades
.
His
main
interest
remained
in
the
sciences
,
especially
biology
,
while
he
treated
other
school
subjects
with
indifference
,
to
the
dismay
of
his
demanding
father
.
Upon
leaving
school
,
Bell
travelled
to
London
to
live
with
his
grandfather
,
Alexander
Bell
.
During
the
year
he
spent
with
his
grandfather
,
a
love
of
learning
was
born
,
with
long
hours
spent
in
serious
discussion
and
study
.
The
elder
Bell
took
great
efforts
to
have
his
young
pupil
learn
to
speak
clearly
and
with
conviction
,
the
attributes
that
his
pupil
would
need
to
become
a
teacher
himself
.
At
age
16
,
Bell
secured
a
position
as
a
"
pupil-teacher
"
of
elocution
and
music
,
in
Weston
House
Academy
,
at
Elgin
,
Moray
,
Scotland
.
Although
he
was
enrolled
as
a
student
in
Latin
and
Greek
,
he
instructed
classes
himself
in
return
for
board
and
£
10
per
session
.
The
following
year
,
he
attended
the
University
of
Edinburgh
;
joining
his
older
brother
Melville
who
had
enrolled
there
the
previous
year
.
In
1868
,
not
long
before
he
departed
for
Canada
with
his
family
,
Bell
completed
his
matriculation
exams
and
was
accepted
for
admission
to
the
University
of
London
.
His
father
encouraged
Bell
's
interest
in
speech
and
,
in
1863
,
took
his
sons
to
see
a
unique
automaton
,
developed
by
Sir
Charles
Wheatstone
based
on
the
earlier
work
of
Baron
Wolfgang
von
Kempelen
.
The
rudimentary
"
mechanical
man
"
simulated
a
human
voice
.
Bell
was
fascinated
by
the
machine
and
after
he
obtained
a
copy
of
von
Kempelen
's
book
,
published
in
German
,
and
had
laboriously
translated
it
,
he
and
his
older
brother
Melville
built
their
own
automaton
head
.
Their
father
,
highly
interested
in
their
project
,
offered
to
pay
for
any
supplies
and
spurred
the
boys
on
with
the
enticement
of
a
"
big
prize
"
if
they
were
successful
.
While
his
brother
constructed
the
throat
and
larynx
,
Bell
tackled
the
more
difficult
task
of
recreating
a
realistic
skull
.
His
efforts
resulted
in
a
remarkably
lifelike
head
that
could
"
speak
"
,
albeit
only
a
few
words
.
The
boys
would
carefully
adjust
the
"
lips
"
and
when
a
bellows
forced
air
through
the
windpipe
,
a
very
recognizable
"
Mama
"
ensued
,
to
the
delight
of
neighbors
who
came
to
see
the
Bell
invention
.
Intrigued
by
the
results
of
the
automaton
,
Bell
continued
to
experiment
with
a
live
subject
,
the
family
's
Skye
Terrier
,
"
Trouve
"
.
After
he
taught
it
to
growl
continuously
,
Bell
would
reach
into
its
mouth
and
manipulate
the
dog
's
lips
and
vocal
cords
to
produce
a
crude-sounding
"
Ow
ah
oo
ga
ma
ma
"
.
With
little
convincing
,
visitors
believed
his
dog
could
articulate
"
How
are
you
grandma
?
"
More
indicative
of
his
playful
nature
,
his
experiments
convinced
onlookers
that
they
saw
a
"
talking
dog
"
.
However
,
these
initial
forays
into
experimentation
with
sound
led
Bell
to
undertake
his
first
serious
work
on
the
transmission
of
sound
,
using
tuning
forks
to
explore
resonance
.
At
the
age
of
19
,
he
wrote
a
report
on
his
work
and
sent
it
to
philologist
Alexander
Ellis
,
a
colleague
of
his
father
(
who
would
later
be
portrayed
as
Professor
Henry
Higgins
in
Pygmalion
)
.
Ellis
immediately
wrote
back
indicating
that
the
experiments
were
similar
to
existing
work
in
Germany
,
and
also
lent
Bell
a
copy
of
Hermann
von
Helmholtz
's
work
,
The
Sensations
of
Tone
as
a
Physiological
Basis
for
the
Theory
of
Music
.
Dismayed
to
find
that
groundbreaking
work
had
already
been
undertaken
by
Helmholtz
who
had
conveyed
vowel
sounds
by
means
of
a
similar
tuning
fork
"
contraption
"
,
he
pored
over
the
German
scientist
's
book
.
Working
from
his
own
erroneous
mistranslation
of
a
French
edition
,
Bell
fortuitously
then
made
a
deduction
that
would
be
the
underpinning
of
all
his
future
work
on
transmitting
sound
,
reporting
:
"
Without
knowing
much
about
the
subject
,
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
vowel
sounds
could
be
produced
by
electrical
means
,
so
could
consonants
,
so
could
articulate
speech
.
"
He
also
later
remarked
:
"
I
thought
that
Helmholtz
had
done
it
...
and
that
my
failure
was
due
only
to
my
ignorance
of
electricity
.
It
was
a
valuable
blunder
...
If
I
had
been
able
to
read
German
in
those
days
,
I
might
never
have
commenced
my
experiments

In
1865
,
when
the
Bell
family
moved
to
London
,
Bell
returned
to
Weston
House
as
an
assistant
master
and
,
in
his
spare
hours
,
continued
experiments
on
sound
using
a
minimum
of
laboratory
equipment
.
Bell
concentrated
on
experimenting
with
electricity
to
convey
sound
and
later
installed
a
telegraph
wire
from
his
room
in
Somerset
College
to
that
of
a
friend
.
Throughout
late
1867
,
his
health
faltered
mainly
through
exhaustion
.
His
younger
brother
,
Edward
"
Ted
,
"
was
similarly
bed-ridden
,
suffering
from
tuberculosis
.
While
Bell
recovered
(
by
then
referring
to
himself
in
correspondence
as
"
A.G.
Bell
"
)
and
served
the
next
year
as
an
instructor
at
Somerset
College
,
Bath
,
England
,
his
brother
's
condition
deteriorated
.
Edward
would
never
recover
.
Upon
his
brother
's
death
,
Bell
returned
home
in
1867
.
His
older
brother
Melville
had
married
and
moved
out
.
With
aspirations
to
obtain
a
degree
at
University
College
London
,
Bell
considered
his
next
years
as
preparation
for
the
degree
examinations
,
devoting
his
spare
time
at
his
family
's
residence
to
studying
.
Helping
his
father
in
Visible
Speech
demonstrations
and
lectures
brought
Bell
to
Susanna
E.
Hull
's
private
school
for
the
deaf
in
South
Kensington
,
London
.
His
first
two
pupils
were
"
deaf
mute
"
girls
who
made
remarkable
progress
under
his
tutelage
.
While
his
older
brother
seemed
to
achieve
success
on
many
fronts
including
opening
his
own
elocution
school
,
applying
for
a
patent
on
an
invention
,
and
starting
a
family
,
Bell
continued
as
a
teacher
.
However
,
in
May
1870
,
Melville
died
from
complications
due
to
tuberculosis
,
causing
a
family
crisis
.
His
father
had
also
suffered
a
debilitating
illness
earlier
in
life
and
had
been
restored
to
health
by
a
convalescence
in
Newfoundland
.
Bell
's
parents
embarked
upon
a
long-planned
move
when
they
realized
that
their
remaining
son
was
also
sickly
.
Acting
decisively
,
Alexander
Melville
Bell
asked
Bell
to
arrange
for
the
sale
of
all
the
family
property
,
[
N

]
conclude
all
of
his
brother
's
affairs
(
Bell
took
over
his
last
student
,
curing
a
pronounced
lisp
)
,
and
join
his
father
and
mother
in
setting
out
for
the
"
New
World
"
.
Reluctantly
,
Bell
also
had
to
conclude
a
relationship
with
Marie
Eccleston
,
who
,
as
he
had
surmised
,
was
not
prepared
to
leave
England
with
him
.
In
1870
,
at
age
23
,
Bell
,
his
brother
's
widow
,
Caroline
(
Margaret
Ottaway
)
,
and
his
parents
travelled
on
the
SS
Nestorian
to
Canada
.
After
landing
at
Quebec
City
the
Bells
transferred
to
another
steamer
to
Montreal
and
then
boarded
a
train
to
Paris
,
Ontario
,
to
stay
with
the
Reverend
Thomas
Henderson
,
a
family
friend
.
After
a
brief
stay
with
the
Hendersons
,
the
Bell
family
purchased
a
farm
of
10.5
acres
(
42,000
m
2
)
at
Tutelo
Heights
(
now
called
Tutela
Heights
)
,
near
Brantford
,
Ontario
.
The
property
consisted
of
an
orchard
,
large
farm
house
,
stable
,
pigsty
,
hen-house
,
and
a
carriage
house
,
which
bordered
the
Grand
River
.
[
N

]
At
the
homestead
,
Bell
set
up
his
own
workshop
in
the
converted
carriage
house
near
to
what
he
called
his
"
dreaming
place
"
,
a
large
hollow
nestled
in
trees
at
the
back
of
the
property
above
the
river
.
Despite
his
frail
condition
upon
arriving
in
Canada
,
Bell
found
the
climate
and
environs
to
his
liking
,
and
rapidly
improved
.
[
N
10
]
He
continued
his
interest
in
the
study
of
the
human
voice
and
when
he
discovered
the
Six
Nations
Reserve
across
the
river
at
Onondaga
,
he
learned
the
Mohawk
language
and
translated
its
unwritten
vocabulary
into
Visible
Speech
symbols
.
For
his
work
,
Bell
was
awarded
the
title
of
Honorary
Chief
and
participated
in
a
ceremony
where
he
donned
a
Mohawk
headdress
and
danced
traditional
dances
.
[
N
11
]
After
setting
up
his
workshop
,
Bell
continued
experiments
based
on
Helmholtz
's
work
with
electricity
and
sound
.
He
also
modified
a
melodeon
(
a
type
of
pump
organ
)
so
that
it
could
transmit
its
music
electrically
over
a
distance
.
Once
the
family
was
settled
in
,
both
Bell
and
his
father
made
plans
to
establish
a
teaching
practice
and
in
1871
,
he
accompanied
his
father
to
Montreal
,
where
Melville
was
offered
a
position
to
teach
his
System
of
Visible
Speech
.
Bell
's
father
was
invited
by
Sarah
Fuller
,
principal
of
the
Boston
School
for
Deaf
Mutes
(
which
continues
today
as
the
public
Horace
Mann
School
for
the
Deaf
)
,
in
Boston
,
Massachusetts
,
to
introduce
the
Visible
Speech
System
by
providing
training
for
Fuller
's
instructors
,
but
he
declined
the
post
in
favor
of
his
son
.
Traveling
to
Boston
in
April
1871
,
Bell
proved
successful
in
training
the
school
's
instructors
.
He
was
subsequently
asked
to
repeat
the
program
at
the
American
Asylum
for
Deaf-mutes
in
Hartford
,
Connecticut
,
and
the
Clarke
School
for
the
Deaf
in
Northampton
,
Massachusetts
.
Returning
home
to
Brantford
after
six
months
abroad
,
Bell
continued
his
experiments
with
his
"
harmonic
telegraph
"
.
[
N
12
]
The
basic
concept
behind
his
device
was
that
messages
could
be
sent
through
a
single
wire
if
each
message
was
transmitted
at
a
different
pitch
,
but
work
on
both
the
transmitter
and
receiver
was
needed
.
Unsure
of
his
future
,
he
first
contemplated
returning
to
London
to
complete
his
studies
,
but
decided
to
return
to
Boston
as
a
teacher
.
His
father
helped
him
set
up
his
private
practice
by
contacting
Gardiner
Greene
Hubbard
,
the
president
of
the
Clarke
School
for
the
Deaf
for
a
recommendation
.
Teaching
his
father
's
system
,
in
October
1872
,
Alexander
Bell
opened
his
"
School
of
Vocal
Physiology
and
Mechanics
of
Speech
"
in
Boston
,
which
attracted
a
large
number
of
deaf
pupils
,
with
his
first
class
numbering
30
students
.
While
he
was
working
as
a
private
tutor
,
one
of
his
most
famous
pupils
was
Helen
Keller
,
who
came
to
him
as
a
young
child
unable
to
see
,
hear
,
or
speak
.
She
was
later
to
say
that
Bell
dedicated
his
life
to
the
penetration
of
that
"
inhuman
silence
which
separates
and
estranges
.
"
In
1893
,
Keller
performed
the
sod-breaking
ceremony
for
the
construction
of
the
new
Bell
's
new
Volta
Bureau
,
dedicated
to
"
the
increase
and
diffusion
of
knowledge
relating
to
the
deaf
"
.
Several
influential
people
of
the
time
,
including
Bell
,
viewed
deafness
as
something
that
should
be
eradicated
,
and
also
believed
that
with
resources
and
effort
they
could
teach
the
deaf
to
speak
and
avoid
the
use
of
sign
language
,
thus
enabling
their
integration
within
the
wider
society
from
which
many
were
often
being
excluded
.
In
several
schools
,
children
were
mistreated
,
for
example
by
having
their
hands
tied
behind
their
backs
so
they
could
not
communicate
by
signing
—
the
only
language
they
knew
—
in
an
attempt
to
force
them
to
attempt
oral
communication
.
Owing
to
his
efforts
to
suppress
the
teaching
of
sign
language
,
Bell
is
often
viewed
negatively
by
those
embracing
Deaf
culture
.
In
the
following
year
,
Bell
became
professor
of
Vocal
Physiology
and
Elocution
at
the
Boston
University
School
of
Oratory
.
During
this
period
,
he
alternated
between
Boston
and
Brantford
,
spending
summers
in
his
Canadian
home
.
At
Boston
University
,
Bell
was
"
swept
up
"
by
the
excitement
engendered
by
the
many
scientists
and
inventors
residing
in
the
city
.
He
continued
his
research
in
sound
and
endeavored
to
find
a
way
to
transmit
musical
notes
and
articulate
speech
,
but
although
absorbed
by
his
experiments
,
he
found
it
difficult
to
devote
enough
time
to
experimentation
.
While
days
and
evenings
were
occupied
by
his
teaching
and
private
classes
,
Bell
began
to
stay
awake
late
into
the
night
,
running
experiment
after
experiment
in
rented
facilities
at
his
boarding
house
.
Keeping
"
night
owl
"
hours
,
he
worried
that
his
work
would
be
discovered
and
took
great
pains
to
lock
up
his
notebooks
and
laboratory
equipment
.
Bell
had
a
specially
made
table
where
he
could
place
his
notes
and
equipment
inside
a
locking
cover
.
Worse
still
,
his
health
deteriorated
as
he
suffered
severe
headaches
.
Returning
to
Boston
in
fall
1873
,
Bell
made
a
fateful
decision
to
concentrate
on
his
experiments
in
sound
.
Deciding
to
give
up
his
lucrative
private
Boston
practice
,
Bell
retained
only
two
students
,
six-year-
old
"
Georgie
"
Sanders
,
deaf
from
birth
,
and
15
-
year
-
old
Mabel
Hubbard
.
Each
pupil
would
play
an
important
role
in
the
next
developments
.
George
's
father
,
Thomas
Sanders
,
a
wealthy
businessman
,
offered
Bell
a
place
to
stay
in
nearby
Salem
with
Georgie
's
grandmother
,
complete
with
a
room
to
"
experiment
"
.
Although
the
offer
was
made
by
George
's
mother
and
followed
the
year-long
arrangement
in
1872
where
her
son
and
his
nurse
had
moved
to
quarters
next
to
Bell
's
boarding
house
,
it
was
clear
that
Mr.
Sanders
was
backing
the
proposal
.
The
arrangement
was
for
teacher
and
student
to
continue
their
work
together
,
with
free
room
and
board
thrown
in
.
Mabel
was
a
bright
,
attractive
girl
who
was
ten
years
Bell
's
junior
,
but
became
the
object
of
his
affection
.
Having
lost
her
hearing
after
a
near-fatal
bout
of
scarlet
fever
close
to
her
fifth
birthday
,
[
N
13
]
she
had
learned
to
read
lips
but
her
father
,
Gardiner
Greene
Hubbard
,
Bell
's
benefactor
and
personal
friend
,
wanted
her
to
work
directly
with
her
teacher
.
By
1874
,
Bell
's
initial
work
on
the
harmonic
telegraph
had
entered
a
formative
stage
,
with
progress
made
both
at
his
new
Boston
"
laboratory
"
(
a
rented
facility
)
and
at
his
family
home
in
Canada
a
big
success
.
[
N
14
]
While
working
that
summer
in
Brantford
,
Bell
experimented
with
a
"
phonautograph
"
,
a
pen-like
machine
that
could
draw
shapes
of
sound
waves
on
smoked
glass
by
tracing
their
vibrations
.
Bell
thought
it
might
be
possible
to
generate
undulating
electrical
currents
that
corresponded
to
sound
waves
.
Bell
also
thought
that
multiple
metal
reeds
tuned
to
different
frequencies
like
a
harp
would
be
able
to
convert
the
undulating
currents
back
into
sound
.
But
he
had
no
working
model
to
demonstrate
the
feasibility
of
these
ideas
.
In
1874
,
telegraph
message
traffic
was
rapidly
expanding
and
in
the
words
of
Western
Union
President
William
Orton
,
had
become
"
the
nervous
system
of
commerce
"
.
Orton
had
contracted
with
inventors
Thomas
Edison
and
Elisha
Gray
to
find
a
way
to
send
multiple
telegraph
messages
on
each
telegraph
line
to
avoid
the
great
cost
of
constructing
new
lines
.
When
Bell
mentioned
to
Gardiner
Hubbard
and
Thomas
Sanders
that
he
was
working
on
a
method
of
sending
multiple
tones
on
a
telegraph
wire
using
a
multi-reed
device
,
the
two
wealthy
patrons
began
to
financially
support
Bell
's
experiments
.
Patent
matters
would
be
handled
by
Hubbard
's
patent
attorney
,
Anthony
Pollok
.
In
March
1875
,
Bell
and
Pollok
visited
the
famous
scientist
Joseph
Henry
,
who
was
then
director
of
the
Smithsonian
Institution
,
and
asked
Henry
's
advice
on
the
electrical
multi-reed
apparatus
that
Bell
hoped
would
transmit
the
human
voice
by
telegraph
.
Henry
replied
that
Bell
had
"
the
germ
of
a
great
invention
"
.
When
Bell
said
that
he
did
not
have
the
necessary
knowledge
,
Henry
replied
,
"
Get
it
!
"
That
declaration
greatly
encouraged
Bell
to
keep
trying
,
even
though
he
did
not
have
the
equipment
needed
to
continue
his
experiments
,
nor
the
ability
to
create
a
working
model
of
his
ideas
.
However
,
a
chance
meeting
in
1874
between
Bell
and
Thomas
A.
Watson
,
an
experienced
electrical
designer
and
mechanic
at
the
electrical
machine
shop
of
Charles
Williams
,
changed
all
that
.
With
financial
support
from
Sanders
and
Hubbard
,
Bell
hired
Thomas
Watson
as
his
assistant
,
[
N
15
]
and
the
two
of
them
experimented
with
acoustic
telegraphy
.
On
June
2
,
1875
,
Watson
accidentally
plucked
one
of
the
reeds
and
Bell
,
at
the
receiving
end
of
the
wire
,
heard
the
overtones
of
the
reed
;
overtones
that
would
be
necessary
for
transmitting
speech
.
That
demonstrated
to
Bell
that
only
one
reed
or
armature
was
necessary
,
not
multiple
reeds
.
This
led
to
the
"
gallows
"
sound
-
powered
telephone
,
which
could
transmit
indistinct
,
voice
-
like
sounds
,
but
not
clear
speech
.
In
1875
,
Bell
developed
an
acoustic
telegraph
and
drew
up
a
patent
application
for
it
.
Since
he
had
agreed
to
share
U.S.
profits
with
his
investors
Gardiner
Hubbard
and
Thomas
Sanders
,
Bell
requested
that
an
associate
in
Ontario
,
George
Brown
,
attempt
to
patent
it
in
Britain
,
instructing
his
lawyers
to
apply
for
a
patent
in
the
U.S.
only
after
they
received
word
from
Britain
(
Britain
would
issue
patents
only
for
discoveries
not
previously
patented
elsewhere
)
.
Meanwhile
,
Elisha
Gray
was
also
experimenting
with
acoustic
telegraphy
and
thought
of
a
way
to
transmit
speech
using
a
water
transmitter
.
On
February
14
,
1876
,
Gray
filed
a
caveat
with
the
U.S.
Patent
Office
for
a
telephone
design
that
used
a
water
transmitter
.
That
same
morning
,
Bell
's
lawyer
filed
Bell
's
application
with
the
patent
office
.
There
is
considerable
debate
about
who
arrived
first
and
Gray
later
challenged
the
primacy
of
Bell
's
patent
.
Bell
was
in
Boston
on
February
14
and
did
not
arrive
in
Washington
until
February
26
.
Bell
's
patent
174,465
,
was
issued
to
Bell
on
March
7
,
1876
,
by
the
U.S.
Patent
Office
.
Bell
's
patent
covered
"
the
method
of
,
and
apparatus
for
,
transmitting
vocal
or
other
sounds
telegraphically
...
by
causing
electrical
undulations
,
similar
in
form
to
the
vibrations
of
the
air
accompanying
the
said
vocal
or
other
sound
"
[
N
16
]
Bell
returned
to
Boston
the
same
day
and
the
next
day
resumed
work
,
drawing
in
his
notebook
a
diagram
similar
to
that
in
Gray
's
patent
caveat
.
On
March
10
,
1876
,
three
days
after
his
patent
was
issued
,
Bell
succeeded
in
getting
his
telephone
to
work
,
using
a
liquid
transmitter
similar
to
Gray
's
design
.
Vibration
of
the
diaphragm
caused
a
needle
to
vibrate
in
the
water
,
varying
the
electrical
resistance
in
the
circuit
.
When
Bell
spoke
the
famous
sentence
"
Mr.
Watson
—
Come
here
—
I
want
to
see
you
"
into
the
liquid
transmitter
,
Watson
,
listening
at
the
receiving
end
in
an
adjoining
room
,
heard
the
words
clearly
.
Although
Bell
was
,
and
still
is
,
accused
of
stealing
the
telephone
from
Gray
,
Bell
used
Gray
's
water
transmitter
design
only
after
Bell
's
patent
had
been
granted
,
and
only
as
a
proof
of
concept
scientific
experiment
,
to
prove
to
his
own
satisfaction
that
intelligible
"
articulate
speech
"
(
Bell
's
words
)
could
be
electrically
transmitted
.
After
March
1876
,
Bell
focused
on
improving
the
electromagnetic
telephone
and
never
used
Gray
's
liquid
transmitter
in
public
demonstrations
or
commercial
use
.
The
question
of
priority
for
the
variable
resistance
feature
of
the
telephone
was
raised
by
the
examiner
before
he
approved
Bell
's
patent
application
.
He
told
Bell
that
his
claim
for
the
variable
resistance
feature
was
also
described
in
Gray
's
caveat
.
Bell
pointed
to
a
variable
resistance
device
in
Bell
's
previous
application
in
which
Bell
described
a
cup
of
mercury
,
not
water
.
Bell
had
filed
the
mercury
application
at
the
patent
office
a
year
earlier
on
February
25
,
1875
,
long
before
Elisha
Gray
described
the
water
device
.
In
addition
,
Gray
abandoned
his
caveat
,
and
because
he
did
not
contest
Bell
's
priority
,
the
examiner
approved
Bell
's
patent
on
March
3
,
1876
.
Gray
had
reinvented
the
variable
resistance
telephone
,
but
Bell
was
the
first
to
write
down
the
idea
and
the
first
to
test
it
in
a
telephone
.
The
patent
examiner
,
Zenas
Fisk
Wilber
,
later
stated
in
an
affidavit
that
he
was
an
alcoholic
who
was
much
in
debt
to
Bell
's
lawyer
,
Marcellus
Bailey
,
with
whom
he
had
served
in
the
Civil
War
.
He
claimed
he
showed
Gray
's
patent
caveat
to
Bailey
.
Wilber
also
claimed
(
after
Bell
arrived
in
Washington
D.C.
from
Boston
)
that
he
showed
Gray
's
caveat
to
Bell
and
that
Bell
paid
him
$
100
.
Bell
claimed
they
discussed
the
patent
only
in
general
terms
,
although
in
a
letter
to
Gray
,
Bell
admitted
that
he
learned
some
of
the
technical
details
.
Bell
denied
in
an
affidavit
that
he
ever
gave
Wilber
any
money
.
Continuing
his
experiments
in
Brantford
,
Bell
brought
home
a
working
model
of
his
telephone
.
On
August
3
,
1876
,
from
the
telegraph
office
in
Mount
Pleasant
five
miles
(
eight
km
)
away
from
Brantford
,
Bell
sent
a
tentative
telegram
indicating
that
he
was
ready
.
With
curious
onlookers
packed
into
the
office
as
witnesses
,
faint
voices
were
heard
replying
.
The
following
night
,
he
amazed
guests
as
well
as
his
family
when
a
message
was
received
at
the
Bell
home
from
Brantford
,
four
miles
(
six
km
)
distant
,
along
an
improvised
wire
strung
up
along
telegraph
lines
and
fences
,
and
laid
through
a
tunnel
.
This
time
,
guests
at
the
household
distinctly
heard
people
in
Brantford
reading
and
singing
.
These
experiments
clearly
proved
that
the
telephone
could
work
over
long
distances
.
Bell
and
his
partners
,
Hubbard
and
Sanders
,
offered
to
sell
the
patent
outright
to
Western
Union
for
$
100,000
.
The
president
of
Western
Union
balked
,
countering
that
the
telephone
was
nothing
but
a
toy
.
Two
years
later
,
he
told
colleagues
that
if
he
could
get
the
patent
for
$
25
million
he
would
consider
it
a
bargain
.
By
then
,
the
Bell
company
no
longer
wanted
to
sell
the
patent
.
Bell
's
investors
would
become
millionaires
,
while
he
fared
well
from
residuals
and
at
one
point
had
assets
of
nearly
one
million
dollars
.
Bell
began
a
series
of
public
demonstrations
and
lectures
to
introduce
the
new
invention
to
the
scientific
community
as
well
as
the
general
public
.
A
short
time
later
,
his
demonstration
of
an
early
telephone
prototype
at
the
1876
Centennial
Exposition
in
Philadelphia
brought
the
telephone
to
international
attention
.
Influential
visitors
to
the
exhibition
included
Emperor
Pedro
II
of
Brazil
.
Later
Bell
had
the
opportunity
to
demonstrate
the
invention
personally
to
Sir
William
Thomson
(
later
,
Lord
Kelvin
)
,
a
renowned
Scottish
scientist
,
as
well
as
to
Queen
Victoria
,
who
had
requested
a
private
audience
at
Osborne
House
,
her
Isle
of
Wight
home
.
She
called
the
demonstration
"
most
extraordinary
"
.
The
enthusiasm
surrounding
Bell
's
public
displays
laid
the
groundwork
for
universal
acceptance
of
the
revolutionary
device
.
The
Bell
Telephone
Company
was
created
in
1877
,
and
by
1886
,
more
than
150,000
people
in
the
U.S.
owned
telephones
.
Bell
Company
engineers
made
numerous
other
improvements
to
the
telephone
,
which
emerged
as
one
of
the
most
successful
products
ever
.
In
1879
,
the
Bell
company
acquired
Edison
's
patents
for
the
carbon
microphone
from
Western
Union
.
This
made
the
telephone
practical
for
longer
distances
,
and
it
was
no
longer
necessary
to
shout
to
be
heard
at
the
receiving
telephone
.
In
January
1915
,
Bell
made
the
first
ceremonial
transcontinental
telephone
call
.
Calling
from
the
AT&T
head
office
at
15
Dey
Street
in
New
York
City
,
Bell
was
heard
by
Thomas
Watson
at
333
Grant
Avenue
in
San
Francisco
.
The
New
York
Times
reported
:
As
is
sometimes
common
in
scientific
discoveries
,
simultaneous
developments
can
occur
,
as
evidenced
by
a
number
of
inventors
who
were
at
work
on
the
telephone
.
Over
a
period
of
18
years
,
the
Bell
Telephone
Company
faced
587
court
challenges
to
its
patents
,
including
five
that
went
to
the
U.S.
Supreme
Court
,
but
none
was
successful
in
establishing
priority
over
the
original
Bell
patent
and
the
Bell
Telephone
Company
never
lost
a
case
that
had
proceeded
to
a
final
trial
stage
.
Bell
's
laboratory
notes
and
family
letters
were
the
key
to
establishing
a
long
lineage
to
his
experiments
.
The
Bell
company
lawyers
successfully
fought
off
myriad
lawsuits
generated
initially
around
the
challenges
by
Elisha
Gray
and
Amos
Dolbear
.
In
personal
correspondence
to
Bell
,
both
Gray
and
Dolbear
had
acknowledged
his
prior
work
,
which
considerably
weakened
their
later
claims
.
On
January
13
,
1887
,
the
U,S
.
Government
moved
to
annul
the
patent
issued
to
Bell
on
the
grounds
of
fraud
and
misrepresentation
.
After
a
series
of
decisions
and
reversals
,
the
Bell
company
won
a
decision
in
the
Supreme
Court
,
though
a
couple
of
the
original
claims
from
the
lower
court
cases
were
left
undecided
.
By
the
time
that
the
trial
wound
its
way
through
nine
years
of
legal
battles
,
the
U.S.
prosecuting
attorney
had
died
and
the
two
Bell
patents
(
No.
174,465
dated
March
7
,
1876
and
No.
186,787
dated
January
30
,
1877
)
were
no
longer
in
effect
,
although
the
presiding
judges
agreed
to
continue
the
proceedings
due
to
the
case
's
importance
as
a
"
precedent
"
.
With
a
change
in
administration
and
charges
of
conflict
of
interest
(
on
both
sides
)
arising
from
the
original
trial
,
the
US
Attorney
General
dropped
the
lawsuit
on
November
30
,
1897
leaving
several
issues
undecided
on
the
merits
.
During
a
deposition
filed
for
the
1887
trial
,
Italian
inventor
Antonio
Meucci
also
claimed
to
have
created
the
first
working
model
of
a
telephone
in
Italy
in
1834
.
In
1886
,
in
the
first
of
three
cases
in
which
he
was
involved
,
Meucci
took
the
stand
as
a
witness
in
the
hopes
of
establishing
his
invention
's
priority
.
Meucci
's
evidence
in
this
case
was
disputed
due
to
a
lack
of
material
evidence
for
his
inventions
as
his
working
models
were
purportedly
lost
at
the
laboratory
of
American
District
Telegraph
(
ADT
)
of
New
York
,
which
was
later
incorporated
as
a
subsidiary
of
Western
Union
in
1901
.
Meucci
's
work
,
like
many
other
inventors
of
the
period
,
was
based
on
earlier
acoustic
principles
and
despite
evidence
of
earlier
experiments
,
the
final
case
involving
Meucci
was
eventually
dropped
upon
Meucci
's
death
.
However
,
due
to
the
efforts
of
Congressman
Vito
Fossella
,
the
U.S.
House
of
Representatives
on
June
11
,
2002
stated
that
Meucci's
"
work
in
the
invention
of
the
telephone
should
be
acknowledged
"
,
even
though
this
did
not
put
an
end
to
a
still
contentious
issue
.
[

]
Some
modern
scholars
do
not
agree
with
the
claims
that
Bell
's
work
on
the
telephone
was
influenced
by
Meucci
's
inventions
.
[
N
18
]
The
value
of
the
Bell
patent
was
acknowledged
throughout
the
world
,
and
patent
applications
were
made
in
most
major
countries
,
but
when
Bell
had
delayed
the
German
patent
application
,
the
electrical
firm
of
Siemens
&
Halske
(
S&H
)
managed
to
set
up
a
rival
manufacturer
of
Bell
telephones
under
their
own
patent
.
The
Siemens
company
produced
near-identical
copies
of
the
Bell
telephone
without
having
to
pay
royalties
.
The
establishment
of
the
International
Bell
Telephone
Company
in
Brussels
,
Belgium
in
1880
,
as
well
as
a
series
of
agreements
in
other
countries
eventually
consolidated
a
global
telephone
operation
.
The
strain
put
on
Bell
by
his
constant
appearances
in
court
,
necessitated
by
the
legal
battles
,
eventually
resulted
in
his
resignation
from
the
company
.
[
N
19
]
On
July
11
,
1877
,
a
few
days
after
the
Bell
Telephone
Company
was
established
,
Bell
married
Mabel
Hubbard
(
1857
–
1923
)
at
the
Hubbard
estate
in
Cambridge
,
Massachusetts
.
His
wedding
present
to
his
bride
was
to
turn
over
1,487
of
his
1,497
shares
in
the
newly
formed
Bell
Telephone
Company
.
Shortly
thereafter
,
the
newlyweds
embarked
on
a
year-long
honeymoon
in
Europe
.
During
that
excursion
,
Bell
took
a
handmade
model
of
his
telephone
with
him
,
making
it
a
"
working
holiday
"
.
The
courtship
had
begun
years
earlier
;
however
,
Bell
waited
until
he
was
more
financially
secure
before
marrying
.
Although
the
telephone
appeared
to
be
an
"
instant
"
success
,
it
was
not
initially
a
profitable
venture
and
Bell
's
main
sources
of
income
were
from
lectures
until
after
1897
.
One
unusual
request
exacted
by
his
fiancée
was
that
he
use
"
Alec
"
rather
than
the
family
's
earlier
familiar
name
of
"
Aleck
"
.
From
1876
,
he
would
sign
his
name
"
Alec
Bell
"
.
They
had
four
children
:
The
Bell
family
home
was
in
Cambridge
,
Massachusetts
,
until
1880
when
Bell
's
father
-
in-
law
bought
a
house
in
Washington
,
D.C.
,
and
later
in
1882
bought
a
home
in
the
same
city
for
Bell
's
family
,
so
that
they
could
be
with
him
while
he
attended
to
the
numerous
court
cases
involving
patent
disputes
.
Bell
was
a
British
subject
throughout
his
early
life
in
Scotland
and
later
in
Canada
until
1882
,
when
he
became
a
naturalized
citizen
of
the
United
States
.
In
1915
,
he
characterized
his
status
as
:
"
I
am
not
one
of
those
hyphenated
Americans
who
claim
allegiance
to
two
countries
.
"
Despite
this
declaration
,
Bell
has
been
proudly
claimed
as
a
"
native
son
"
by
all
three
countries
he
resided
in
:
the
United
States
,
Canada
,
and
the
United
Kingdom
.
By
1885
,
a
new
summer
retreat
was
contemplated
.
That
summer
,
the
Bells
had
a
vacation
on
Cape
Breton
Island
in
Nova
Scotia
,
spending
time
at
the
small
village
of
Baddeck
.
Returning
in
1886
,
Bell
started
building
an
estate
on
a
point
across
from
Baddeck
,
overlooking
Bras
d'Or
Lake
.
By
1889
,
a
large
house
,
christened
The
Lodge
was
completed
and
two
years
later
,
a
larger
complex
of
buildings
,
including
a
new
laboratory
,
were
begun
that
the
Bells
would
name
Beinn
Bhreagh
(
Gaelic
:
beautiful
mountain
)
after
Bell
's
ancestral
Scottish
highlands
.
[
N
21
]
Bell
also
built
the
Bell
Boatyard
on
the
estate
,
employing
up
to
40
people
building
experimental
craft
as
well
as
wartime
lifeboats
and
workboats
for
the
Royal
Canadian
Navy
and
pleasure
craft
for
the
Bell
family
.
An
enthusiastic
boater
,
Bell
and
his
family
sailed
or
rowed
a
long
series
of
vessels
on
Bras
d'Or
Lake
,
ordering
additional
vessels
from
the
H.W.
Embree
and
Sons
boatyard
in
Port
Hawkesbury
,
Nova
Scotia
.
In
his
final
,
and
some
of
his
most
productive
years
,
Bell
split
his
residency
between
Washington
,
D.C.
,
where
he
and
his
family
initially
resided
for
most
of
the
year
,
and
at
Beinn
Bhreagh
where
they
spent
increasing
amounts
of
time
.
Until
the
end
of
his
life
,
Bell
and
his
family
would
alternate
between
the
two
homes
,
but
Beinn
Bhreagh
would
,
over
the
next
30
years
,
become
more
than
a
summer
home
as
Bell
became
so
absorbed
in
his
experiments
that
his
annual
stays
lengthened
.
Both
Mabel
and
Bell
became
immersed
in
the
Baddeck
community
and
were
accepted
by
the
villagers
as
"
their
own
"
.
[
N
22
]
The
Bells
were
still
in
residence
at
Beinn
Bhreagh
when
the
Halifax
Explosion
occurred
on
December
6
,
1917
.
Mabel
and
Bell
mobilized
the
community
to
help
victims
in
Halifax
.
Although
Alexander
Graham
Bell
is
most
often
associated
with
the
invention
of
the
telephone
,
his
interests
were
extremely
varied
.
According
to
one
of
his
biographers
,
Charlotte
Gray
,
Bell
's
work
ranged
"
unfettered
across
the
scientific
landscape
"
and
he
often
went
to
bed
voraciously
reading
the
Encyclopædia
Britannica
,
scouring
it
for
new
areas
of
interest
.
The
range
of
Bell
's
inventive
genius
is
represented
only
in
part
by
the
18
patents
granted
in
his
name
alone
and
the
12
he
shared
with
his
collaborators
.
These
included
14
for
the
telephone
and
telegraph
,
four
for
the
photophone
,
one
for
the
phonograph
,
five
for
aerial
vehicles
,
four
for
"
hydroairplanes
"
and
two
for
selenium
cells
.
Bell
's
inventions
spanned
a
wide
range
of
interests
and
included
a
metal
jacket
to
assist
in
breathing
,
the
audiometer
to
detect
minor
hearing
problems
,
a
device
to
locate
icebergs
,
investigations
on
how
to
separate
salt
from
seawater
,
and
work
on
finding
alternative
fuels
.
Bell
worked
extensively
in
medical
research
and
invented
techniques
for
teaching
speech
to
the
deaf
.
During
his
Volta
Laboratory
period
,
Bell
and
his
associates
considered
impressing
a
magnetic
field
on
a
record
as
a
means
of
reproducing
sound
.
Although
the
trio
briefly
experimented
with
the
concept
,
they
could
not
develop
a
workable
prototype
.
They
abandoned
the
idea
,
never
realizing
they
had
glimpsed
a
basic
principle
which
would
one
day
find
its
application
in
the
tape
recorder
,
the
hard
disc
and
floppy
disc
drive
and
other
magnetic
media
.
Bell
's
own
home
used
a
primitive
form
of
air
conditioning
,
in
which
fans
blew
currents
of
air
across
great
blocks
of
ice
.
He
also
anticipated
modern
concerns
with
fuel
shortages
and
industrial
pollution
.
Methane
gas
,
he
reasoned
,
could
be
produced
from
the
waste
of
farms
and
factories
.
At
his
Canadian
estate
in
Nova
Scotia
,
he
experimented
with
composting
toilets
and
devices
to
capture
water
from
the
atmosphere
.
In
a
magazine
interview
published
shortly
before
his
death
,
he
reflected
on
the
possibility
of
using
solar
panels
to
heat
houses
.
Bell
and
his
assistant
Charles
Sumner
Tainter
jointly
invented
a
wireless
telephone
,
named
a
photophone
,
which
allowed
for
the
transmission
of
both
sounds
and
normal
human
conversations
on
a
beam
of
light
.
Both
men
later
became
full
associates
in
the
Volta
Laboratory
Association
.
On
June
21
,
1880
,
Bell
's
assistant
transmitted
a
wireless
voice
telephone
message
a
considerable
distance
,
from
the
roof
of
the
Franklin
School
in
Washington
,
D.C.
,
to
Bell
at
the
window
of
his
laboratory
,
some
213
metres
(
700
ft
)
away
,
19
years
before
the
first
voice
radio
transmissions
.
Bell
believed
the
photophone
's
principles
were
his
life
's
"
greatest
achievement
"
,
telling
a
reporter
shortly
before
his
death
that
the
photophone
was
"
the
greatest
invention
[
I
have
]
ever
made
,
greater
than
the
telephone
"
.
The
photophone
was
a
precursor
to
the
fiber-optic
communication
systems
which
achieved
popular
worldwide
usage
in
the
1980s
.
Its
master
patent
was
issued
in
December
1880
,
many
decades
before
the
photophone
's
principles
came
into
popular
use
.
Bell
is
also
credited
with
developing
one
of
the
early
versions
of
a
metal
detector
in
1881
.
The
device
was
quickly
put
together
in
an
attempt
to
find
the
bullet
in
the
body
of
U.S.
President
James
Garfield
.
According
to
some
accounts
,
the
metal
detector
worked
flawlessly
in
tests
but
did
not
find
the
assassin's
bullet
partly
because
the
metal
bed
frame
on
which
the
President
was
lying
disturbed
the
instrument
,
resulting
in
static
.
The
president
's
surgeons
,
who
were
skeptical
of
the
device
,
ignored
Bell
's
requests
to
move
the
president
to
a
bed
not
fitted
with
metal
springs
.
Alternatively
,
although
Bell
had
detected
a
slight
sound
on
his
first
test
,
the
bullet
may
have
been
lodged
too
deeply
to
be
detected
by
the
crude
apparatus
.
Bell
's
own
detailed
account
,
presented
to
the
American
Association
for
the
Advancement
of
Science
in
1882
,
differs
in
several
particulars
from
most
of
the
many
and
varied
versions
now
in
circulation
,
most
notably
by
concluding
that
extraneous
metal
was
not
to
blame
for
failure
to
locate
the
bullet
.
Perplexed
by
the
peculiar
results
he
had
obtained
during
an
examination
of
Garfield
,
Bell
"
...
proceeded
to
the
Executive
Mansion
the
next
morning
...
to
ascertain
from
the
surgeons
whether
they
were
perfectly
sure
that
all
metal
had
been
removed
from
the
neighborhood
of
the
bed
.
It
was
then
recollected
that
underneath
the
horse-hair
mattress
on
which
the
President
lay
was
another
mattress
composed
of
steel
wires
.
Upon
obtaining
a
duplicate
,
the
mattress
was
found
to
consist
of
a
sort
of
net
of
woven
steel
wires
,
with
large
meshes
.
The
extent
of
the
[
area
that
produced
a
response
from
the
detector
]
having
been
so
small
,
as
compared
with
the
area
of
the
bed
,
it
seemed
reasonable
to
conclude
that
the
steel
mattress
had
produced
no
detrimental
effect
.
"
In
a
footnote
,
Bell
adds
that
"
The
death
of
President
Garfield
and
the
subsequent
post-mortem
examination
,
however
,
proved
that
the
bullet
was
at
too
great
a
distance
from
the
surface
to
have
affected
our
apparatus
.
"
The
March
1906
Scientific
American
article
by
American
pioneer
William
E.
Meacham
explained
the
basic
principle
of
hydrofoils
and
hydroplanes
.
Bell
considered
the
invention
of
the
hydroplane
as
a
very
significant
achievement
.
Based
on
information
gained
from
that
article
he
began
to
sketch
concepts
of
what
is
now
called
a
hydrofoil
boat
.
Bell
and
assistant
Frederick
W.
"
Casey
"
Baldwin
began
hydrofoil
experimentation
in
the
summer
of
1908
as
a
possible
aid
to
airplane
takeoff
from
water
.
Baldwin
studied
the
work
of
the
Italian
inventor
Enrico
Forlanini
and
began
testing
models
.
This
led
him
and
Bell
to
the
development
of
practical
hydrofoil
watercraft
.
During
his
world
tour
of
1910
–11
,
Bell
and
Baldwin
met
with
Forlanini
in
France
.
They
had
rides
in
the
Forlanini
hydrofoil
boat
over
Lake
Maggiore
.
Baldwin
described
it
as
being
as
smooth
as
flying
.
On
returning
to
Baddeck
,
a
number
of
initial
concepts
were
built
as
experimental
models
,
including
the
Dhonnas
Beag
,
the
first
self
-propelled
Bell
-
Baldwin
hydrofoil
.
The
experimental
boats
were
essentially
proof-of-concept
prototypes
that
culminated
in
the
more
substantial
HD
-
4
,
powered
by
Renault
engines
.
A
top
speed
of
54
miles
per
hour
(
87
km
/h
)
was
achieved
,
with
the
hydrofoil
exhibiting
rapid
acceleration
,
good
stability
and
steering
along
with
the
ability
to
take
waves
without
difficulty
.
In
1913
,
Dr.
Bell
hired
Walter
Pinaud
,
a
Sydney
yacht
designer
and
builder
as
well
as
the
proprietor
of
Pinaud
's
Yacht
Yard
in
Westmount
,
Nova
Scotia
to
work
on
the
pontoons
of
the
HD
-
4
.
Pinaud
soon
took
over
the
boatyard
at
Bell
Laboratories
on
Beinn
Bhreagh
,
Bell
's
estate
near
Baddeck
,
Nova
Scotia
.
Pinaud
's
experience
in
boat-
building
enabled
him
to
make
useful
design
changes
to
the
HD
-4
.
After
the
First
World
War
,
work
began
again
on
the
HD
-4
.
Bell
's
report
to
the
U.S.
Navy
permitted
him
to
obtain
two
350
horsepower
(
260
kilowatts
)
engines
in
July
1919
.
On
September
9
,
1919
,
the
HD
-
4
set
a
world
marine
speed
record
of
70.86
miles
per
hour
(
114.04
kilometres
per
hour
)
,
a
record
which
stood
for
ten
years
.
In
1898
,
Bell
experimented
with
tetrahedral
box
kites
and
wings
constructed
of
multiple
compound
tetrahedral
kites
covered
in
maroon
silk
.
[
N
23
]
The
tetrahedral
wings
were
named
Cygnet
I
,
II
and
III
,
and
were
flown
both
unmanned
and
manned
(
Cygnet
I
crashed
during
a
flight
carrying
Selfridge
)
in
the
period
from
1907
–
1912
.
Some
of
Bell
's
kites
are
on
display
at
the
Alexander
Graham
Bell
National
Historic
Site
.
Bell
was
a
supporter
of
aerospace
engineering
research
through
the
Aerial
Experiment
Association
(
AEA
)
,
officially
formed
at
Baddeck
,
Nova
Scotia
,
in
October
1907
at
the
suggestion
of
his
wife
Mabel
and
with
her
financial
support
after
the
sale
of
some
of
her
real
estate
.
The
AEA
was
headed
by
Bell
and
the
founding
members
were
four
young
men
:
American
Glenn
H.
Curtiss
,
a
motorcycle
manufacturer
at
the
time
and
who
held
the
title
"
world
's
fastest
man
"
,
having
ridden
his
self
-constructed
motor
bicycle
around
in
the
shortest
time
,
and
who
was
later
awarded
the
Scientific
American
Trophy
for
the
first
official
one-kilometre
flight
in
the
Western
hemisphere
,
and
who
later
became
a
world
-
renowned
airplane
manufacturer
;
Lieutenant
Thomas
Selfridge
,
an
official
observer
from
the
U.S.
Federal
government
and
one
of
the
few
people
in
the
army
who
believed
that
aviation
was
the
future
;
Frederick
W.
Baldwin
,
the
first
Canadian
and
first
British
subject
to
pilot
a
public
flight
in
Hammondsport
,
New
York
,
and
J.A.D.
McCurdy
—
Baldwin
and
McCurdy
being
new
engineering
graduates
from
the
University
of
Toronto
.
The
AEA
's
work
progressed
to
heavier
-
than
-
air
machines
,
applying
their
knowledge
of
kites
to
gliders
.
Moving
to
Hammondsport
,
the
group
then
designed
and
built
the
Red
Wing
,
framed
in
bamboo
and
covered
in
red
silk
and
powered
by
a
small
air-cooled
engine
.
On
March
12
,
1908
,
over
Keuka
Lake
,
the
biplane
lifted
off
on
the
first
public
flight
in
North
America
.
[
N

]
[

]
The
innovations
that
were
incorporated
into
this
design
included
a
cockpit
enclosure
and
tail
rudder
(
later
variations
on
the
original
design
would
add
ailerons
as
a
means
of
control
)
.
One
of
the
AEA
's
inventions
,
a
practical
wingtip
form
of
the
aileron
,
was
to
become
a
standard
component
on
all
aircraft
.
[
N
26
]
The
White
Wing
and
June
Bug
were
to
follow
and
by
the
end
of
1908
,
over
150
flights
without
mishap
had
been
accomplished
.
However
,
the
AEA
had
depleted
its
initial
reserves
and
only
a
$
15,000
grant
from
Mrs.
Bell
allowed
it
to
continue
with
experiments
.
Lt.
Selfridge
had
also
become
the
first
person
killed
in
a
powered
heavier
-
than
-
air
flight
in
a
crash
of
the
Wright
Flyer
at
Fort
Myer
,
Virginia
,
on
September
17
,
1908
.
Their
final
aircraft
design
,
the
Silver
Dart
,
embodied
all
of
the
advancements
found
in
the
earlier
machines
.
On
February
23
,
1909
,
Bell
was
present
as
the
Silver
Dart
flown
by
J.A.D.
McCurdy
from
the
frozen
ice
of
Bras
d'
Or
,
made
the
first
aircraft
flight
in
Canada
.
Bell
had
worried
that
the
flight
was
too
dangerous
and
had
arranged
for
a
doctor
to
be
on
hand
.
With
the
successful
flight
,
the
AEA
disbanded
and
the
Silver
Dart
would
revert
to
Baldwin
and
McCurdy
who
began
the
Canadian
Aerodrome
Company
and
would
later
demonstrate
the
aircraft
to
the
Canadian
Army
.
Bell
was
connected
with
the
eugenics
movement
in
the
United
States
.
In
his
lecture
Memoir
upon
the
formation
of
a
deaf
variety
of
the
human
race
presented
to
the
National
Academy
of
Sciences
on
November
13
,
1883
he
noted
that
congenitally
deaf
parents
were
more
likely
to
produce
deaf
children
and
tentatively
suggested
that
couples
where
both
parties
were
deaf
should
not
marry
.
However
,
it
was
his
hobby
of
livestock
breeding
which
led
to
his
appointment
to
biologist
David
Starr
Jordan
's
Committee
on
Eugenics
,
under
the
auspices
of
the
American
Breeders
'
Association
.
The
committee
unequivocally
extended
the
principle
to
man
.
From
1912
until
1918
he
was
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
scientific
advisers
to
the
Eugenics
Record
Office
associated
with
Cold
Spring
Harbor
Laboratory
in
New
York
,
and
regularly
attended
meetings
.
In
1921
,
he
was
the
honorary
president
of
the
Second
International
Congress
of
Eugenics
held
under
the
auspices
of
the
American
Museum
of
Natural
History
in
New
York
.
Organisations
such
as
these
advocated
passing
laws
(
with
success
in
some
states
)
that
established
the
compulsory
sterilization
of
people
deemed
to
be
,
as
Bell
called
them
,
a
"
defective
variety
of
the
human
race
.
"
By
the
late
1930s
,
about
half
the
states
in
the
U.S.
had
eugenics
laws
,
and
California
's
compulsory
sterilization
law
was
used
as
a
model
for
that
of
Nazi
Germany
.
A
large
number
of
Bell
's
writings
,
personal
correspondence
,
notebooks
,
papers
and
other
documents
reside
at
both
the
United
States
Library
of
Congress
Manuscript
Division
(
as
the
Alexander
Graham
Bell
Family
Papers
)
,
and
at

Bell
Institute
,
Cape
Breton
University
,
Nova
Scotia
;

In
1880
,
Bell
received
the
Volta
Prize
with
a
purse
of
50,000
francs
(
approximately
US
$
250,000
in
today
's
dollars
)
for
the
invention
of
the
telephone
from
the
Académie
française
,
representing
the
French
government
.
Among
the
luminaries
who
judged
were
Victor
Hugo
and
Alexandre
Dumas
.
The
Volta
Prize
was
conceived
by
Napoleon
Bonaparte
in
1801
,
and
named
in
honor
of
Alessandro
Volta
,
with
Bell
receiving
the
third
grand
prize
in
its
history
.
Since
Bell
was
becoming
increasingly
affluent
,
he
used
his
prize
money
to
create
endowment
funds
(
the
'
Volta
Fund
'
)
and
institutions
in
and
around
the
United
States
capital
of
Washington
,
D.C.
.
These
included
the
prestigious
'
Volta
Laboratory
Association
'
(
1880
)
,
also
known
as
the
Volta
Laboratory
and
as
the
'
Alexander
Graham
Bell
Laboratory
'
,
and
which
eventually
led
to
the
Volta
Bureau
(
1887
)
as
a
center
for
studies
on
deafness
which
is
still
in
operation
in
Georgetown
,
Washington
,
D.C
.
The
Volta
Laboratory
became
an
experimental
facility
devoted
to
scientific
discovery
,
and
the
very
next
year
it
improved
Edison
's
phonograph
by
substituting
wax
for
tinfoil
as
the
recording
medium
and
incising
the
recording
rather
than
indenting
it
,
key
upgrades
that
Edison
himself
later
adopted
.
The
laboratory
was
also
the
site
where
he
and
his
associate
invented
his
"
proudest
achievement
"
,
"
the
photophone
"
,
the
"
optical
telephone
"
which
presaged
fibre
optical
telecommunications
,
while
the
Volta
Bureau
would
later
evolve
into
the
Alexander
Graham
Bell
Association
for
the
Deaf
and
Hard
of
Hearing
(
the
AG
Bell
)
,
a
leading
center
for
the
research
and
pedagogy
of
deafness
.
In
partnership
with
Gardiner
Greene
Hubbard
,
Bell
helped
establish
the
publication
Science
during
the
early
1880s
.
In
1898
,
Bell
was
elected
as
the
second
president
of
the
National
Geographic
Society
,
serving
until
1903
,
and
was
primarily
responsible
for
the
extensive
use
of
illustrations
,
including
photography
,
in
the
magazine
.
he
also
became
a
Regent
of
the
Smithsonian
Institution
(
1898
–
1922
)
.
The
French
government
conferred
on
him
the
decoration
of
the
Légion
d'honneur
(
Legion
of
Honor
)
;
the
Royal
Society
of
Arts
in
London
awarded
him
the
Albert
Medal
in
1902
;
the
University
of
Würzburg
,
Bavaria
,
granted
him
a
PhD
,
and
he
was
awarded
the
Franklin
Institute
's
Elliott
Cresson
Medal
in
1912
.
He
was
one
of
the
founders
of
the
American
Institute
of
Electrical
Engineers
in
1884
,
and
served
as
its
president
from
1891–92
.
Bell
was
later
awarded
the
AIEE
's
Edison
Medal
in
1914
"
For
meritorious
achievement
in
the
invention
of
the
telephone
"
.
Honors
and
tributes
flowed
to
Bell
in
increasing
numbers
as
his
most
famous
invention
became
ubiquitous
and
his
personal
fame
grew
.
Bell
received
numerous
honorary
degrees
from
colleges
and
universities
,
to
the
point
that
the
requests
almost
became
burdensome
.
During
his
life
he
also
received
dozens
of
major
awards
,
medals
and
other
tributes
.
These
included
statuary
monuments
to
both
him
and
the
new
form
of
communication
his
telephone
created
,
notably
the
Bell
Telephone
Memorial
erected
in
his
honor
in
Alexander
Graham
Bell
Gardens
in
Brantford
,
Ontario
,
in
1917
.
In
1936
the
US
Patent
Office
declared
Bell
first
on
its
list
of
the
country
's
greatest
inventors
,
leading
to
the
US
Post
Office
issuing
a
commemorative
stamp
honoring
Bell
in
1940
as
part
of
its
'
Famous
Americans
Series
'
.
The
First
Day
of
Issue
ceremony
was
held
on
October
28
in
Boston
,
Massachusetts
,
the
city
where
Bell
spent
considerable
time
on
research
and
working
with
the
deaf
.
The
Bell
stamp
became
very
popular
and
sold
out
in
little
time
.
The
stamp
became
,
and
remains
to
this
day
,
the
most
valuable
one
of
the
series
.
The
150th
anniversary

in
history
after
having
been
listed
in
the
National
Library
of
Scotland

.
Bell
's
name
is
still
widely
known
and
used
as
part
of
the
names
of
dozens
of
educational
institutes
,
corporate
namesakes
,
street
and
place
names
around
the
world
.
Bell
died
of
complications
arising
from
diabetes
on
August
2
,
1922
,
at
his
private
estate
,
Beinn
Bhreagh
,
Nova
Scotia
,
at
age
75
.
Bell
had
also
been
afflicted
with
pernicious
anemia
.
His
last
view
of
the
land
he
had
inhabited
was
by
moonlight
on
his
mountain
estate
at

While
tending
to
him
after
his
long
illness
,
Mabel
,
his
wife
,
whispered
,
"
Do
n't
leave
me
.
"
By
way
of
reply
,
Bell
traced
the
sign
for
"
no
"
in
the
air
—
and
then
he
died
.
Bell
's
coffin
was
constructed
of
Beinn
Bhreagh
pine
by
his
laboratory
staff
,
lined
with
the
same
red
silk
fabric
used
in
his
tetrahedral
kite
experiments
.
To
help
celebrate
his
life
,
his
wife
asked
guests
not
to
wear
black
(
the
traditional
funeral
color
)
while
attending
his
service
,
during
which
soloist
Jean
MacDonald
sang
a
verse
of
Robert
Louis
Stevenson
's
"
Requiem
"
:
Dr.
Alexander
Graham
Bell
was
buried
atop
Beinn
Bhreagh
mountain
,
on
his
estate
where
he
had
resided
increasingly
for
the
last
35
years
of
his
life
,
overlooking
Bras
d'Or
Lake
.
He
was
survived
by
his
wife
Mabel
,
his
two
daughters
,
Elsie
May
and
Marian
,
and
nine
of
his

Comics
are
a
medium
used
to
express
ideas
by
images
,
often
combined
with
text
or
other
visual
information
.
Comics
frequently
takes
the
form
of
juxtaposed
sequences
of
panels
of
images
.
Often
textual
devices
such
as
speech
balloons
,
captions
,
and
onomatopoeia
indicate
dialogue
,
narration
,
sound
effects
,
or
other
information
.
Size
and
arrangement
of
panels
contribute
to
narrative
pacing
.
Cartooning
and
similar
forms
of
illustration
are
the
most
common
image-making
means
in
comics
;
fumetti
is
a
form
which
uses
photographic
images
.
Common
forms
of
comics
include
comic
strips
,
editorial
and
gag
cartoons
,
and
comic
books
.
Since
the
late
20th
century
,
bound
volumes
such
as
graphic
novels
,
comics
albums
,
and
tankōbon
have
become
increasingly
common
,
and
online
webcomics
have
proliferated
in
the
21st
century
.
The
history
of
comics
has
followed
different
paths
in
different
cultures
.
Scholars
have
posited
a
pre-history
as
far
back
as
the
Lascaux
cave
paintings
.
By
the
mid-20th
century
,
comics
flourished
particularly
in
the
United
States
,
western
Europe
(
especially
in
France
and
Belgium
)
,
and
Japan
.
The
history
of
European
comics
is
often
traced
to
Rodolphe
Töpffer
's
cartoon
strips
of
the
1830s
,
and
became
popular
following
the
success
in
the
1930s
of
strips
and
books
such
as
The
Adventures
of
Tintin
.
American
comics
emerged
as
a
mass
medium
in
the
early
20th
century
with
the
advent
of
newspaper
comic
strips
;
magazine
-style
comic
books
followed
in
the
1930s
,
in
which
the
superhero
genre
became
prominent
after
Superman
appeared
in
1938
.
Histories
of
Japanese
comics
and
cartooning
(
manga
)
propose
origins
as
early
as
the
12th
century
.
Modern
comic
strips
emerged
in
Japan
in
the
early
20th
century
,
and
the
output
of
comics
magazines
and
books
rapidly
expanded
in
the
post-World
War
II
era
with
the
popularity
of
cartoonists
such
as
Osamu
Tezuka
.
Comics
has
had
a
lowbrow
reputation
for
much
of
its
history
,
but
towards
the
end
of
the
20th
century
began
to
find
greater
acceptance
with
the
public
and
in
academia
.
The
English
term
comics
is
used
as
a
singular
noun
when
it
refers
to
the
medium
and
a
plural
when
referring
to
particular
instances
,
such
as
individual
strips
or
comic
books
.
Though
the
term
derives
from
the
humorous
(
or
comic
)
work
that
predominated
in
early
American
newspaper
comic
strips
,
it
has
become
standard
also
for
non-humorous
works
.
It
is
common
in
English
to
refer
to
the
comics
of
different
cultures
by
the
terms
used
in
their
original
languages
,
such
as
manga
for
Japanese
comics
,
or
bandes
dessinées
for
French
-
language
comics
.
There
is
no
consensus
amongst
theorists
and
historians
on
a
definition
of
comics
;
some
emphasize
the
combination
of
images
and
text
,
some
sequentiality
or
other
image
relations
,
and
others
historical
aspects
such
as
mass
reproduction
or
the
use
of
recurring
characters
.
The
increasing
cross-pollination
of
concepts
from
different
comics
cultures
and
eras
has
further
made
definition
difficult
.
The
European
,
American
,
and
Japanese
comics
traditions
have
followed
different
paths
.
Europeans
have
seen
their
tradition
as
beginning
with
the
Swiss
Rodolphe
Töpffer
from
as
early
as
1827
and
Americans
have
seen
the
origin
of
theirs
in
Richard
F.
Outcault
's
1890s
newspaper
strip
The
Yellow
Kid
,
though
many
Americans
have
come
to
recognize
Töpffer
's
precedence
.
Japan
had
a
long
prehistory
of
satirical
cartoons
and
comics
leading
up
to
the
World
War
II
era
.
The
ukiyo-e
artist
Hokusai
popularized
the
Japanese
term
for
comics
and
cartooning
,
manga
,
in
the
early
19th
century
.
In
the
post-war
era
modern
Japanese
comics
began
to
flourish
when
Osamu
Tezuka
produced
a
prolific
body
of
work
.
Towards
the
close
of
the
20th
century
,
these
three
traditions
converged
in
a
trend
towards
book-
length
comics
:
the
comics
album
in
Europe
,
the
tankōbon
[
a
]
in
Japan
,
and
the
graphic
novel
in
the
English
-speaking
countries
.
Outside
of
these
genealogies
,
comics
theorists
and
historians
have
seen
precedents
for
comics
in
the
Lascaux
cave
paintings
in
France
(
some
of
which
appear
to
be
chronological
sequences
of
images
)
,
Egyptian
hieroglyphs
,
Trajan
's
Column
in
Rome
,
the
11th
-century
Norman
Bayeux
Tapestry
,
the
1370
bois
Protat
woodcut
,
the
15th
-
century
Ars
moriendi
and
block
books
,
Michelangelo
's
The
Last
Judgment
in
the
Sistine
Chapel
,
and
William
Hogarth
's
17th
-
century
sequential
engravings
,
amongst
others
.
[

Illustrated
humour
periodicals
were
popular
in
19th
-
century
Britain
,
the
earliest
of
which
was
the
short-
lived
The
Glasgow
Looking
Glass
in
1825
.
The
most
popular
was
Punch
,
which
popularized
the
term
cartoon
for
its
humorous
caricatures
.
On
occasion
the
cartoons
in
these
magazines
appeared
in
sequences
;
the
character
Ally
Sloper
featured
in
the
earliest
serialized
comic
strip
when
the
character
began
to
feature
in
its
own
weekly
magazine
in
1884
.
American
comics
developed
out
of
such
magazines
as
Puck
,
Judge
,
and
Life
.
The
success
of
illustrated
humour
supplements
in
the
New
York
World
and
later
the
New
York
American
,
particularly
Outcault
's
The
Yellow
Kid
,
led
to
the
development
of
newspaper
comic
strips
.
Early
Sunday
strips
were
full-
page
and
often
in
colour
.
Between
1896
and
1901
cartoonists
experimented
with
sequentiality
,
movement
,
and
speech
balloons
.
Shorter
,
black
-
and
-
white
daily
strips
began
to
appear
early
in
the
20th
century
,
and
became
established
in
newspapers
after
the
success
in
1907
of
Bud
Fisher
's
Mutt
and
Jeff
.
Humour
strips
predominated
at
first
,
and
in
the
1920s
and
1930s
strips
with
continuing
stories
in
genres
such
as
adventure
and
drama
also
became
popular
.
Thin
periodicals
called
comic
books
appeared
in
the
1930s
,
at
first
reprinting
newspaper
comic
strips
;
by
the
end
of
the
decade
,
original
content
began
to
dominate
.
The
success
in
1938
of
Action
Comics
and
its
lead
hero
Superman
marked
the
beginning
of
the
Golden
Age
of
Comic
Books
,
in
which
the
superhero
genre
was
prominent
.
The
popularity
of
superhero
comic
books
declined
following
World
War
II
,
while
comic
book
sales
continued
to
increase
as
other
genres
proliferated
,
such
as
romance
,
westerns
,
crime
,
horror
,
and
humour
.
Following
a
sales
peak
in
the
early
1950s
,
the
content
of
comic
books
(
particularly
crime
and
horror
)
was
subjected
to
scrutiny
from
parent
groups
and
government
agencies
,
which
culminated
in
Senate
hearings
that
led
to
the
establishment
of
the
Comics
Code
Authority
self
-
censoring
body
.
The
Code
has
been
blamed
for
stunting
the
growth
of
American
comics
and
maintaining
its
low
status
in
American
society
for
much
of
the
remainder
of
the
century
.
Superheroes
re-established
themselves
as
the
most
prominent
comic
book
genre
by
the
early
1960s
.
Underground
comix
challenged
the
Code
and
readers
with
adult
,
countercultural
content
in
the
late
1960s
and
early
1970s
.
The
underground
gave
birth
to
the
alternative
comics
movement
in
the
1980s
and
its
mature
,
often
experimental
content
in
non-superhero
genres
.
From
the
1980s
,
mainstream
sensibilities
were
reasserted
and
serialization
became
less
common
as
the
number
of
comics
magazines
decreased
and
many
comics
began
to
be
published
directly
as
albums
.
Smaller
publishers
such
as
L'Association
that
published
longer
works
in
non-traditional
formats
by
auteur-istic
creators
also
became
common
.
Since
the
1990s
,
mergers
resulted
in
fewer
large
publishers
,
while
smaller
publishers
proliferated
.
Sales
overall
continued
to
grow
despite
the
trend
towards
a
shrinking
print
market
.
Japanese
comics
and
cartooning
(
manga
)
,
[
g
]
have
a
history
that
has
been
seen
as
far
back
as
the
anthropomorphic
characters
in
the
12th
-
to
-
13th
-
century
Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga
,
17th
-
century
toba-e
and
kibyōshi
picture
books
,
and
woodblock
prints
such
as
ukiyo-e
which
were
popular
between
the
17th
and
20th
centuries
.
The
kibyōshi
contained
examples
of
sequential
images
,
movement
lines
,
and
sound
effects
.
Illustrated
magazines
for
Western
expatriates
introduced
Western-style
satirical
cartoons
to
Japan
in
the
late
19th
century
.
New
publications
in
both
the
Western
and
Japanese
styles
became
popular
,
and
at
the
end
of
the
1890s
,
American
-style
newspaper
comics
supplements
began
to
appear
in
Japan
,
as
well
as
some
American
comic
strips
.
1900
saw
the
debut
of
the
Jiji
Manga
in
the
Jiji
Shinpō
newspaper
—
the
first
use
of
the
word
"
manga
"
in
its
modern
sense
,
and
where
,
in
1902
,
Rakuten
Kitazawa
began
the
first
modern
Japanese
comic
strip
.
By
the
1930s
,
comic
strips
were
serialized
in
large-circulation
monthly
girls
'
and
boys
'
magazine
and
collected
into
hardback
volumes
.
The
modern
era
of
comics
in
Japan
began
after
World
War
II
,
propelled
by
the
success
of
the
serialized
comics
of
the
prolific
Osamu
Tezuka
and
the
comic
strip
Sazae-san
.
Genres
and
audiences
diversified
over
the
following
decades
.
Stories
are
usually
first
serialized
in
magazines
which
are
often
hundreds
of
pages
thick
and
may
over
a
dozen
stories
;
they
are
later
compiled
in
tankōbon
-
format
books
.
At
the
turn
of
the
20th
and
21st
centuries
,
nearly
a
quarter
of
all
printed
material
in
Japan
was
comics
.
translations
became
extremely
popular
in
foreign
markets
—
in
some
cases
equaling
or
surpassing
the
sales
of
domestic
comics
.
Comic
strips
are
generally
short
,
multipanel
comics
that
traditionally
most
commonly
appeared
in
newspapers
.
In
the
US
,
daily
strips
have
normally
occupied
a
single
tier
,
while
Sunday
strips
have
been
given
multiple
tiers
.
In
the
early
20th
century
,
daily
strips
were
typically
in
black
-
and
-
white
and
Sundays
were
usually
in
colour
and
often
occupied
a
full
page
.
Specialized
comics
periodicals
formats
vary
greatly
in
different
cultures
.
Comic
books
,
primarily
an
American
format
,
are
thin
periodicals
usually
published
in
colour
.
European
and
Japanese
comics
are
frequently
serialized
in
magazines
—
monthly
or
weekly
in
Europe
,
and
usually
black
-
and
-
white
and
weekly
in
Japan
.
Japanese
comics
magazine
typically
run
to
hundreds
of
pages
.
Book

length
comics
take
different
forms
in
different
cultures
.
European
comics
albums
are
most
commonly
printed
in
A4
-
size
colour
volumes
.
In
English-speaking
countries
,
bound
volumes
of
comics
are
called
graphic
novels
and
are
available
in
various
formats
.
Despite
incorporating
the
term
"
novel
"
—
a
term
normally
associated
with
fiction
—
"
graphic
novel
"
also
refers
to
non-fiction
and
collections
of
short
works
.
Japanese
comics
are
collected
in
volumes
called
tankōbon
following
magazine
serialization
.
Gag
and
editorial
cartoons
usually
consist
of
a
single
panel
,
often
incorporating
a
caption
or
speech
balloon
.
Definitions
of
comics
which
emphasize
sequence
usually
exclude
gag
,
editorial
,
and
other
single
-
panel
cartoons
;
they
can
be
included
in
definitions
that
emphasize
the
combination
of
word
and
image
.
Gag
cartoons
first
began
to
proliferate
in
broadsheets
published
in
Europe
in
the
18th
and
19th
centuries
,
and
the
term
"
cartoon
"
[

was
first
used
to
describe
them
in
1843
in
the
British
humour
magazine
Punch
.
Comics
in
the
US
has
had
a
lowbrow
reputation
stemming
from
its
roots
in
mass
culture
;
cultural
elites
sometimes
saw
popular
culture
as
threatening
culture
and
society
.
In
the
latter
half
of
the
20th
century
,
popular
culture
won
greater
acceptance
,
and
the
lines
between
high
and
low
culture
began
to
blur
.
Comics
nevertheless
continued
to
be
stigmatized
,
as
the
medium
was
seen
as
entertainment
for
children
and
illiterates
.
The
graphic
novel
—
book
-
length
comics
—
began
to
gain
attention
after
Will
Eisner
popularized
the
term
with
his
book
A
Contract
with
God
(
1978
)
.
The
term
became
widely
known
with
the
public
after
the
commercial
success
of
Maus
,
Watchmen
,
and
The
Dark
Knight
Returns
in
the
mid-1980s
.
In
the
21st
century
graphic
novels
became
established
in
mainstream
bookstores
and
libraries
and
webcomics
became
common
.
The
francophone
Swiss
Rodolphe
Töpffer
produced
comic
strips
beginning
in
1827
,
and
published
theories
behind
the
form
.
Cartoons
appeared
widely
in
newspapers
and
magazines
from
the
19th
century
.
The
success
of
Zig
et
Puce
in
1925
popularized
the
use
of
speech
balloons
in
European
comics
,
after
which
Franco
-Belgian
comics
began
to
dominate
.
The
Adventures
of
Tintin
,
with
its
signature
clear
line
style
,
was
first
serialized
in
newspaper
comics
supplements
beginning
in
1929
,
and
became
an
icon
of
Franco
-Belgian
comics
.
Following
the
success
of
Le
Journal
de
Mickey
(
1934–
44
)
,
dedicated
comics
magazines
and
full-colour
comics
albums
became
the
primary
outlet
for
comics
in
the
mid-20th
century
.
As
in
the
US
,
at
the
time
comics
were
seen
as
infantile
and
a
threat
to
culture
and
literacy
;
commentators
stated
that
"
none
bear
up
to
the
slightest
serious
analysis
"
,
[
c
]
and
that
comics
were
"
the
sabotage
of
all
art
and
all
literature
"
.
[

]
In
the
1960s
,
the
term
bandes
dessinées
(
"
drawn
strips
"
)
came
into
wide
use
in
French
to
denote
the
medium
.
Cartoonists
began
creating
comics
for
mature
audiences
,
and
the
term
"
Ninth
Art
"
[
e
]
was
coined
,
as
comics
began
to
attract
public
and
academic
attention
as
an
artform
.
A
group
including
René
Goscinny
and
Albert
Uderzo
founded
the
magazine
Pilote
in
1959
to
give
artists
greater
freedom
over
their
work
.
Goscinny
and
Uderzo's
The
Adventures
of
Asterix
appeared
in
it
and
went
on
to
become
the
best-selling
French
-
language
comics
series
.
From
1960
,
the
satirical
and
taboo-breaking
Hara
-
Kiri
defied
censorship
laws
in
the
countercultural
spirit
that
led
to
the
May
1968
events
.
Frustration
with
censorship
and
editorial
interference
led
to
a
group
of
Pilote
cartoonists
to
found
the
adults
-only
L'Écho
des
savanes
in
1972
.
Adult-oriented
and
experimental
comics
flourished
in
the
1970s
,
such
as
in
the
experimental
science
fiction
of
Mœbius
and
others
in
Métal
hurlant
,
even
mainstream
publishers
took
to
publishing
prestige
-format
adult
comics
.
Historical
narratives
of
manga
tend
to
focus
either
on
its
recent
,
post
-WWII
history
,
or
on
attempts
to
demonstrates
deep
roots
in
the
past
,
such
as
to
the
Chōjū-jinbutsu
-
giga
picture
scroll
of
the
12th
and
13th
centuries
,
or
the
early
19th
-
century
Hokusai
Manga
.
The
first
historical
overview
of
Japanese
comics
was
Seiki
Hosokibara
's
Nihon
Manga
-
Shi
[
i
]
in
1924
.
Early
post-war
Japanese
criticism
was
mostly
of
a
left-wing
political
nature
until
the
1986
publication
for
Tomofusa
Kure
's
Modern
Manga
:
The
Complete
Picture
,
[
j
]
which
de-emphasized
politics
in
favour
of
formal
aspects
,
such
as
structure
and
a
"
grammar
"
of
comics
.
The
field
of
manga
studies
increased
rapidly
,
with
numerous
books
on
the
subject
appearing
in
the
1990s
.
Formal
theories
of
manga
have
focused
on
developing
a
"
manga
expression
theory
"
,
[
k
]
with
emphasis
on
spatial
relationships
in
the
structure
of
images
on
the
page
,
distinguishing
the
medium
from
film
or
literature
,
in
which
the
flow
of
time
is
the
basic
organizing
element
.
Comics
studies
courses
have
proliferated
at
Japanese
universities
,
and
Japan
Society
for
Studies
in
Cartoon
and
Comics
(
ja
)
[
l
]
was
established
in
2001
to
promote
comics
scholarship
.
The
publication
of
Frederik
L.
Schodt
's
Manga
!
Manga
!
The
World
of
Japanese
Comics
in
1983
led
to
the
spread
of
use
of
the
word
manga
outside
Japan
to
mean
"
Japanese
comics
"
or
"
Japanese-style
comics
"
.
Coulton
Waugh
attempted
the
first
comprehensive
history
of
American
comics
with
The
Comics
(
1947
)
.
Will
Eisner
's
Comics
and
Sequential
Art
(
1985
)
and
Scott
McCloud
's
Understanding
Comics
(
1993
)
were
early
attempts
in
English
to
formalize
the
study
of
comics
.
David
Carrier
's
The
Aesthetics
of
Comics
(
2000
)
was
the
first
full-length
treatment
of
comics
from
a
philosophical
perspective
.
Prominent
American
attempts
at
definitions
of
comics
include
Eisner's
,
McCloud's
,
and
Harvey
's
.
Eisner
described
what
he
called
"
sequential
art
"
as
"
the
arrangement
of
pictures
or
images
and
words
to
narrate
a
story
or
dramatize
an
idea
"
;
Scott
McCloud
defined
comics
"
juxtaposed
pictorial
and
other
images
in
deliberate
sequence
,
intended
to
convey
information
and
/
or
to
produce
an
aesthetic
response
in
the
viewer
"
,
a
strictly
formal
definition
which
detached
comics
from
its
historical
and
cultural
trappings
.
R.
C
.
Harvey
defined
comics
as
"
pictorial
narratives
or
expositions
in
which
words
(
often
lettered
into
the
picture
area
within
speech
balloons
)
usually
contribute
to
the
meaning
of
the
pictures
and
vice
versa
"
.
Each
definition
has
had
its
detractors
.
Harvey
saw
McCloud
's
definition
as
excluding
single
-
panel
cartoons
,
and
objected
to
McCloud
's
de-emphasizing
verbal
elements
,
insisting
"
the
essential
characteristic
of
comics
is
the
incorporation
of
verbal
content
"
.
Aaron
Meskin
saw
McCloud
's
theories
as
an
artificial
attempt
to
legitimize
the
place
of
comics
in
art
history
.
Cross-cultural
study
of
comics
is
complicated
by
the
great
difference
in
meaning
and
scope
of
the
words
for
"
comics
"
in
different
languages
.
The
French
term
for
comics
,
bandes
dessinées
(
"
drawn
strip
"
)
emphasizes
the
juxtaposition
of
drawn
images
as
a
defining
factor
,
which
can
imply
the
exclusion
of
even
photographic
comics
.
The
term
manga
is
used
in
Japanese
to
indicate
all
forms
of
comics
,
cartooning
,
and
caricature
.
Webcomics
are
comics
that
are
available
on
the
internet
.
They
are
able
to
reach
large
audiences
,
and
new
readers
usually
can
access
archived
installments
.
Webcomics
can
make
use
of
an
infinite
canvas
—
meaning
they
are
not
constrained
by
size
or
dimensions
of
a
page
.
Some
consider
storyboards
and
wordless
novels
to
be
comics
.
Film
studios
,
especially
in
animation
,
often
use
sequences
of
images
as
guides
for
film
sequences
.
These
storyboards
are
not
intended
as
an
end
product
and
are
rarely
seen
by
the
public
.
Wordless
novels
are
books
which
use
sequences
of
captionless
images
to
deliver
a
narrative
.
Similar
to
the
problems
of
defining
literature
and
film
,
no
consensus
has
been
reached
on
a
definition
of
the
comics
medium
,
and
attempted
definitions
and
descriptions
have
fallen
prey
to
numerous
exceptions
.
Theorists
such
as
Töpffer
,
R.
C.
Harvey
,
Will
Eisner
,
David
Carrier
,
Alain
Rey
,
and
Lawrence
Grove
emphasize
the
combination
of
text
and
images
,
though
there
are
prominent
examples
of
pantomime
comics
throughout
its
history
.
Other
critics
,
such
as
Thierry
Groensteen
and
Scott
McCloud
,
have
emphasized
the
primacy
of
sequences
of
images
.
Towards
the
close
of
the
20th
century
,
different
cultures
'
discoveries
of
each
other
's
comics
traditions
,
the
rediscovery
of
forgotten
early
comics
forms
,
and
the
rise
of
new
forms
made
defining
comics
a
more
complicated
task
.
European
comics
studies
began
with
Töpffer
's
theories
of
his
own
work
in
the
1840s
,
which
emphasized
panel
transitions
and
the
visual–verbal
combination
.
No
further
progress
was
made
until
the
1970s
.
Pierre
Fresnault
-
Deruelle
then
took
a
semiotics
approach
to
the
study
of
comics
,
analyzing
text–image
relations
,
page-
level
image
relations
,
and
image
discontinuities
,
or
what
Scott
McCloud
later
dubbed
"
closure
"
.
In
1987
,
Henri
Vanlier
introduced
the
term
multicadre
,
or
"
multiframe
"
,
to
refer
to
the
comics
a
page
as
a
semantic
unit
.
By
the
1990s
,
theorists
such
as
Benoît
Peeters
and
Thierry
Groensteen
turned
attention
to
artists
'
poïetic
creative
choices
.
Thierry
Smolderen
and
Harry
Morgan
have
held
relativistic
views
of
the
definition
of
comics
,
a
medium
that
has
taken
various
,
equally
valid
forms
over
its
history
.
Morgan
sees
comics
as
a
subset
of
"
les
littératures
dessinées
"
(
or
"
drawn
literatures
"
)
.
French
theory
has
come
to
give
special
attention
to
the
page
,
in
distinction
from
American
theories
such
as
McCloud
's
which
focus
on
panel
-
to
-
panel
transitions
.
Since
the
mid-2000s
,
Neil
Cohn
has
begun
analyzing
how
comics
are
understood
using
tools
from
cognitive
science
,
extending
beyond
theory
by
using
actual
psychological
and
neuroscience
experiments
.
This
work
has
argued
that
sequential
images
and
page
layouts
both
use
separate
rule-bound
"
grammars
"
to
be
understood
that
extend
beyond
panel
-
to
-
panel
transitions
and
categorical
distinctions
of
types
of
layouts
,
and
that
the
brain
's
comprehension
of
comics
is
similar
to
comprehending
other
domains
,
such
as
language
and
music
.
Many
cultures
have
taken
their
words
for
comics
from
English
,
including
Russian
(
Russian
:
Комикс
,
komiks
)
and
German
(
comic
)
.
Similarly
,
the
Chinese
term
manhua
and
the
Korean
manhwa
derive
from
the
Chinese
characters
with
which
the
Japanese
term
manga
is
written
.
The
English
term
comics
derives
from
the
humorous
(
or
"
comic
"
)
work
which
predominated
in
early
American
newspaper
comic
strips
;
usage
of
the
term
has
become
standard
for
non-humorous
works
as
well
.
The
term
"
comic
book
"
has
a
similarly
confusing
history
:
they
are
most
often
not
humorous
;
nor
are
they
regular
books
,
but
rather
periodicals
.
It
is
common
in
English
to
refer
to
the
comics
of
different
cultures
by
the
terms
used
in
their
original
languages
,
such
as
manga
for
Japanese
comics
,
or
bandes
dessinées
for
French
-
language
Franco
-
Belgian
comics
.
While
comics
are
often
the
work
of
a
single
creator
,
the
labour
of
making
them
is
frequently
divided
between
a
number
of
specialists
.
There
may
be
separate
writers
and
artists
,
and
artists
may
specialize
in
parts
of
the
artwork
such
as
characters
or
backgrounds
,
as
is
common
in
Japan
.
Particularly
in
American
superhero
comic
books
,
the
art
may
be
divided
between
a
penciller
,
who
lays
out
the
artwork
in
pencil
;
an
inker
,
who
finishes
the
artwork
in
ink
;
a
colourist
;
and
a
letterer
,
who
adds
the
captions
and
speech
balloons
.
Panels
are
individual
images
containing
a
segment
of
action
,
often
surrounded
by
a
border
.
Prime
moments
in
a
narrative
are
broken
down
into
panels
via
a
process
called
encapsulation
.
The
reader
puts
the
pieces
together
via
the
process
of
closure
by
using
background
knowledge
and
an
understanding
of
panel
relations
to
combine
panels
mentally
into
events
.
The
size
,
shape
,
and
arrangement
of
panels
each
affect
the
timing
and
pacing
of
the
narrative
.
The
contents
of
a
panel
may
be
asynchronous
,
with
events
depicted
in
the
same
image
not
necessarily
occurring
at
the
same
time
.
Text
is
frequently
incorporated
into
comics
via
speech
balloons
,
captions
,
and
sound
effects
.
Speech
balloons
indicate
dialogue
(
or
thought
,
in
the
case
of
thought
balloons
)
,
with
tails
pointing
at
their
respective
speakers
.
Captions
can
give
voice
to
a
narrator
,
convey
characters
'
dialogue
or
thoughts
,
or
indicate
place
or
time
.
Speech
balloons
themselves
are
strongly
associated
with
comics
,
such
that
the
addition
of
one
to
an
image
is
sufficient
to
turn
the
image
into
comics
.
Sound
effects
mimic
non-vocal
sounds
textually
using
onomatopoeia
sound-words
.
Cartooning
is
most
frequently
used
in
making
comics
,
traditionally
using
ink
(
especially
India
ink
)
with
dip
pens
or
ink
brushes
;
mixed
media
and
digital
technology
have
become
common
.
Cartooning
techniques
such
as
motion
lines
and
abstract
symbols
are
often
employed
.
Bird
migration
is
the
regular
seasonal
movement
,
often
north
and
south
along
a
flyway
,
between
breeding
and
wintering
grounds
.
Many
species
of
bird
migrate
.
Migration
carries
high
costs
in
predation
and
mortality
,
including
from
hunting
by
humans
,
and
is
driven
primarily
by
availability
of
food
.
It
occurs
mainly
in
the
northern
hemisphere
,
where
birds
are
funnelled
on
to
specific
routes
by
natural
barriers
such
as
the
Mediterranean
Sea
or
the
Caribbean
Sea
.
Historically
,
migration
has
been
recorded
as
much
as
3,000
years
ago
by
Ancient
Greek
authors
including
Homer
and
Aristotle
,
and
in
the
Book
of
Job
,
for
species
such
as
storks
,
turtle
doves
,
and
swallows
.
More
recently
,
Johannes
Leche
began
recording
dates
of
arrivals
of
spring
migrants
in
Finland
in
1749
,
and
scientific
studies
have
used
techniques
including
bird
ringing
and
satellite
tracking
.
Threats
to
migratory
birds
have
grown
with
habitat
destruction
especially
of
stopover
and
wintering
sites
,
as
well
as
structures
such
as
power
lines
and
wind
farms
.
The
Arctic
tern
holds
the
long-distance
migration
record
for
birds
,
travelling
between
Arctic
breeding
grounds
and
the
Antarctic
each
year
.
Some
species
of
tubenoses
(
Procellariiformes
)
such
as
albatrosses
circle
the
earth
,
flying
over
the
southern
oceans
,
while
others
such
as
Manx
shearwaters
migrate
14,000
km
(
8,700
mi
)
between
their
northern
breeding
grounds
and
the
southern
ocean
.
Shorter
migrations
are
common
,
including
altitudinal
migrations
on
mountains
such
as
the
Andes
and
Himalayas
.
The
timing
of
migration
seems
to
be
controlled
primarily
by
changes
in
day
length
.
Migrating
birds
navigate
using
celestial
cues
from
the
sun
and
stars
,
the
earth
's
magnetic
field
,
and
probably
also
mental
maps
.
Records
of
bird
migration
were
made
as
much
as
3,000
years
ago
by
the
Ancient
Greek
writers
Hesiod
,
Homer
,
Herodotus
and
Aristotle
.
The
Bible
also
notes
migrations
,
as
in
the
Book
of
Job
(
39:26
)
,
where
the
inquiry
is
made
:
"
Is
it
by
your
insight
that
the
hawk
hovers
,
spreads
its
wings
southward
?
"
The
author
of
Jeremiah
(
8:7
)
wrote
:
"
Even
the
stork
in
the
heavens
knows
its
seasons
,
and
the
turtle
dove
,
the
swift
and
the
crane
keep
the
time
of
their
arrival
.
"
Aristotle
noted
that
cranes
traveled
from
the
steppes
of
Scythia
to
marshes
at
the
headwaters
of
the
Nile
.
Pliny
the
Elder
,
in
his
Historia
Naturalis
,
repeats
Aristotle
's
observations
.
Aristotle
however
suggested
that
swallows
and
other
birds
hibernated
.
This
belief
persisted
as
late
as
1878
,
when
Elliott
Coues
listed
the
titles
of
no
less
than
182
papers
dealing
with
the
hibernation
of
swallows
.
Even
the
"
highly
observant
"
Gilbert
White
,
in
his
posthumously
published
1789
The
Natural
History
of
Selborne
,
quoted
a
man
's
story
about
swallows
being
found
in
a
chalk
cliff
collapse
"
while
he
was
a
schoolboy
at
Brighthelmstone
"
,
though
the
man
denied
being
an
eyewitness
.
However
,
he
also
writes
that
"
as
to
swallows
being
found
in
a
torpid
state
during
the
winter
in
the
Isle
of
Wight
or
any
part
of
this
country
,
I
never
heard
any
such
account
worth
attending
to
"
,
and
that
if
early
swallows
"
happen
to
find
frost
and
snow
they
immediately
withdraw
for
a
time
—
a
circumstance
this
much
more
in
favour
of
hiding
than
migration
"
,
since
he
doubts
they
would
"
return
for
a
week
or
two
to
warmer
latitudes
"
.
It
was
not
until
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
that
migration
as
an
explanation
for
the
winter
disappearance
of
birds
from
northern
climes
was
accepted
.
Thomas
Bewick
's
A
History
of
British
Birds
(
Volume
1
,
1797
)
mentions
a
report
from
"
a
very
intelligent
master
of
a
vessel
"
who
,
"
between
the
islands
of
Minorca
and
Majorca
,
saw
great
numbers
of
Swallows
flying
northward
"
,
and
states
the
situation
in
Britain
as
follows
:
Bewick
then
describes
an
experiment
which
succeeded
in
keeping
swallows
alive
in
Britain
for
several
years
,
where
they
remained
warm
and
dry
through
the
winters
.
He
concludes
:
Migration
is
the
regular
seasonal
movement
,
often
north
and
south
,
undertaken
by
many
species
of
birds
.
Bird
movements
include
those
made
in
response
to
changes
in
food
availability
,
habitat
,
or
weather
.
Sometimes
,
journeys
are
not
termed
"
true
migration
"
because
they
are
irregular
(
nomadism
,
invasions
,
irruptions
)
or
in
only
one
direction
(
dispersal
,
movement
of
young
away
from
natal
area
)
.
Migration
is
marked
by
its
annual
seasonality
.
Non-migratory
birds
are
said
to
be
resident
or
sedentary
.
Approximately
1800
of
the
world
's
10,000
bird
species
are
long-distance
migrants
.
Many
bird
populations
migrate
long
distances
along
a
flyway
.
The
most
common
pattern
involves
flying
north
in
the
spring
to
breed
in
the
temperate
or
Arctic
summer
and
returning
in
the
autumn
to
wintering
grounds
in
warmer
regions
to
the
south
.
Of
course
,
in
the
southern
hemisphere
the
directions
are
reversed
,
but
there
is
less
land
area
in
the
far
south
to
support
long-distance
migration
.
The
primary
motivation
for
migration
appears
to
be
food
;
for
example
,
some
hummingbirds
choose
not
to
migrate
if
fed
through
the
winter
.
Also
,
the
longer
days
of
the
northern
summer
provide
extended
time
for
breeding
birds
to
feed
their
young
.
This
helps
diurnal
birds
to
produce
larger
clutches
than
related
non-migratory
species
that
remain
in
the
tropics
.
As
the
days
shorten
in
autumn
,
the
birds
return
to
warmer
regions
where
the
available
food
supply
varies
little
with
the
season
.
These
advantages
offset
the
high
stress
,
physical
exertion
costs
,
and
other
risks
of
the
migration
.
Predation
can
be
heightened
during
migration
:
Eleonora
's
falcon
Falco
eleonorae
,
which
breeds
on
Mediterranean
islands
,
has
a
very
late
breeding
season
,
coordinated
with
the
autumn
passage
of
southbound
passerine
migrants
,
which
it
feeds
to
its
young
.
A
similar
strategy
is
adopted
by
the
greater
noctule
bat
,
which
preys
on
nocturnal
passerine
migrants
.
The
higher
concentrations
of
migrating
birds
at
stopover
sites
make
them
prone
to
parasites
and
pathogens
,
which
require
a
heightened
immune
response
.
Within
a
species
not
all
populations
may
be
migratory
;
this
is
known
as
"
partial
migration
"
.
Partial
migration
is
very
common
in
the
southern
continents
;
in
Australia
,
44
%
of
non-passerine
birds
and
32
%
of
passerine
species
are
partially
migratory
.
In
some
species
,
the
population
at
higher
latitudes
tends
to
be
migratory
and
will
often
winter
at
lower
latitude
.
The
migrating
birds
bypass
the
latitudes
where
other
populations
may
be
sedentary
,
where
suitable
wintering
habitats
may
already
be
occupied
.
This
is
an
example
of
leap-frog
migration
.
Many
fully
migratory
species
show
leap-frog
migration
(
birds
that
nest
at
higher
latitudes
spend
the
winter
at
lower
latitudes
)
,
and
many
show
the
alternative
,
chain
migration
,
where
populations
'
slide
'
more
evenly
north
and
south
without
reversing
order
.
Within
a
population
,
it
is
common
for
different
ages
and
/
or
sexes
to
have
different
patterns
of
timing
and
distance
.
Female
chaffinches
Fringilla
coelebs
in
Eastern
Fennoscandia
migrate
earlier
in
the
autumn
than
males
do
.
Most
migrations
begin
with
the
birds
starting
off
in
a
broad
front
.
Often
,
this
front
narrows
into
one
or
more
preferred
routes
termed
flyways
.
These
routes
typically
follow
mountain
ranges
or
coastlines
,
sometimes
rivers
,
and
may
take
advantage
of
updrafts
and
other
wind
patterns
or
avoid
geographical
barriers
such
as
large
stretches
of
open
water
.
The
specific
routes
may
be
genetically
programmed
or
learned
to
varying
degrees
.
The
routes
taken
on
forward
and
return
migration
are
often
different
.
A
common
pattern
in
North
America
is
clockwise
migration
,
where
birds
flying
North
tend
to
be
further
West
,
and
flying
South
tend
to
shift
Eastwards
.
Many
,
if
not
most
,
birds
migrate
in
flocks
.
For
larger
birds
,
flying
in
flocks
reduces
the
energy
cost
.
Geese
in
a
V-formation
may
conserve
12
–
20
%
of
the
energy
they
would
need
to
fly
alone
.
Red
knots
Calidris
canutus
and
dunlins
Calidris
alpina
were
found
in
radar
studies
to
fly
5
km
/h
(
3.1
mph
)
faster
in
flocks
than
when
they
were
flying
alone
.
Birds
fly
at
varying
altitudes
during
migration
.
An
expedition
to
Mt.
Everest
found
skeletons
of
northern
pintail
Anas
acuta
and
black
-tailed
godwit
Limosa
limosa
at
5,000
m
(
16,000
ft
)
on
the
Khumbu
Glacier
.
Bar-headed
geese
Anser
indicus
have
been
recorded
by
GPS
flying
at
up
to
6,540
metres
(
21,460
ft
)
while
crossing
the
Himalayas
,
at
the
same
time
engaging
in
the
highest
rates
of
climb
to
altitude
for
any
bird
.
Anecdotal
reports
of
them
flying
much
higher
have
yet
to
be
corroborated
with
any
direct
evidence
.
Seabirds
fly
low
over
water
but
gain
altitude
when
crossing
land
,
and
the
reverse
pattern
is
seen
in
landbirds
.
However
most
bird
migration
is
in
the
range
of
150
to
600
m
(
490
to
1,970
ft
)
.
Bird
strike
aviation
records
from
the
United
States
show
most
collisions
occur
below
600
m
(
2,000
ft
)
and
almost
none
above
1,800
m
(
5,900
ft
)
.
Bird
migration
is
not
limited
to
birds
that
can
fly
.
Most
species
of
penguin
(
Spheniscidae
)
migrate
by
swimming
.
These
routes
can
cover
over
1,000
km
(
620
mi
)
.
Dusky
grouse
Dendragapus
obscurus
perform
altitudinal
migration
mostly
by
walking
.
Emus
Dromaius
novaehollandiae
in
Australia
have
been
observed
to
undertake
long-distance
movements
on
foot
during
droughts
.
The
typical
image
of
migration
is
of
northern
landbirds
,
such
as
swallows
(
Hirundinidae
)
and
birds
of
prey
,
making
long
flights
to
the
tropics
.
However
,
many
Holarctic
wildfowl
and
finch
(
Fringillidae
)
species
winter
in
the
North
Temperate
Zone
,
in
regions
with
milder
winters
than
their
summer
breeding
grounds
.
For
example
,
the
pink-footed
goose
Anser
brachyrhynchus
migrates
from
Iceland
to
Britain
and
neighbouring
countries
,
whilst
the
dark-
eyed
junco
Junco
hyemalis
migrates
from
subarctic
and
arctic
climates
to
the
contiguous
United
States
and
the
American
goldfinch
from
taiga
to
wintering
grounds
extending
from
the
American
South
northwestward
to
Western
Oregon
.
Migratory
routes
and
wintering
grounds
are
traditional
and
learned
by
young
during
their
first
migration
with
their
parents
.
Some
ducks
,
such
as
the
garganey
Anas
querquedula
,
move
completely
or
partially
into
the
tropics
.
The
European
pied
flycatcher
Ficedula
hypoleuca
also
follows
this
migratory
trend
,
breeding
in
Asia
and
Europe
and
wintering
in
Africa
.
Often
,
the
migration
route
of
a
long-distance
migrator
bird
does
n't
follow
a
straight
line
between
breeding
and
wintering
grounds
.
Rather
,
it
could
follow
an
hooked
or
arched
line
,
with
detours
around
geographical
barriers
.
For
most
land-
birds
,
such
barriers
could
consist
in
seas
,
large
water
bodies
or
high
mountain
ranges
,
because
of
the
lack
of
stopover
or
feeding
sites
,
or
the
lack
of
thermal
columns
for
broad-winged
birds
.
The
same
considerations
about
barriers
and
detours
that
apply
to
long-distance
land
-
bird
migration
apply
to
water
birds
,
but
in
reverse
:
a
large
area
of
land
without
bodies
of
water
that
offer
feeding
sites
may
also
be
a
barrier
to
a
bird
that
feeds
in
coastal
waters
.
Detours
avoiding
such
barriers
are
observed
:
for
example
,
brent
geese
Branta
bernicla
migrating
from
the
Taymyr
Peninsula
to
the
Wadden
Sea
travel
via
the
White
Sea
coast
and
the
Baltic
Sea
rather
than
directly
across
the
Arctic
Ocean
and
northern
Scandinavia
.
A
similar
situation
occurs
with
waders
(
called
shorebirds
in
North
America
)
.
Many
species
,
such
as
dunlin
Calidris
alpina
and
western
sandpiper
Calidris
mauri
,
undertake
long
movements
from
their
Arctic
breeding
grounds
to
warmer
locations
in
the
same
hemisphere
,
but
others
such
as
semipalmated
sandpiper
C.
pusilla
travel
longer
distances
to
the
tropics
in
the
Southern
Hemisphere
.
For
some
species
of
waders
,
migration
success
depends
on
the
availability
of
certain
key
food
resources
at
stopover
points
along
the
migration
route
.
This
gives
the
migrants
an
opportunity
to
refuel
for
the
next
leg
of
the
voyage
.
Some
examples
of
important
stopover
locations
are
the
Bay
of
Fundy
and
Delaware
Bay
.
Some
bar-tailed
godwits
Limosa
lapponica
have
the
longest
known
non-stop
flight
of
any
migrant
,
flying
11,000
km
from
Alaska
to
their
New
Zealand
non-breeding
areas
.
Prior
to
migration
,
55
percent
of
their
bodyweight
is
stored
as
fat
to
fuel
this
uninterrupted
journey
.
Seabird
migration
is
similar
in
pattern
to
those
of
the
waders
and
waterfowl
.
Some
,
such
as
the
black
guillemot
Cepphus
grylle
and
some
gulls
,
are
quite
sedentary
;
others
,
such
as
most
terns
and
auks
breeding
in
the
temperate
northern
hemisphere
,
move
varying
distances
south
in
the
northern
winter
.
The
Arctic
tern
Sterna
paradisaea
has
the
longest-
distance
migration
of
any
bird
,
and
sees
more
daylight
than
any
other
,
moving
from
its
Arctic
breeding
grounds
to
the
Antarctic
non-breeding
areas
.
One
Arctic
tern
,
ringed
(
banded
)
as
a
chick
on
the
Farne
Islands
off
the
British
east
coast
,
reached
Melbourne
,
Australia
in
just
three
months
from
fledging
,
a
sea
journey
of
over
22,000
km
(
14,000
mi
)
.
Many
tubenosed
birds
breed
in
the
southern
hemisphere
and
migrate
north
in
the
southern
winter
.
The
most
pelagic
species
,
mainly
in
the
'
tubenose
'
order
Procellariiformes
,
are
great
wanderers
,
and
the
albatrosses
of
the
southern
oceans
may
circle
the
globe
as
they
ride
the
"
roaring
forties
"
outside
the
breeding
season
.
The
tubenoses
spread
widely
over
large
areas
of
open
ocean
,
but
congregate
when
food
becomes
available
.
Many
are
also
among
the
longest-
distance
migrants
;
sooty
shearwaters
Puffinus
griseus
nesting
on
the
Falkland
Islands
migrate
14,000
km
(
8,700
mi
)
between
the
breeding
colony
and
the
North
Atlantic
Ocean
off
Norway
.
Some
Manx
shearwaters
Puffinus
puffinus
do
this
same
journey
in
reverse
.
As
they
are
long-lived
birds
,
they
may
cover
enormous
distances
during
their
lives
;
one
record-breaking
Manx
shearwater
is
calculated
to
have
flown
8
million
km
(
5
million
miles
)
during
its
over
-
50
year
lifespan
.
Some
large
broad-winged
birds
rely
on
thermal
columns
of
rising
hot
air
to
enable
them
to
soar
.
These
include
many
birds
of
prey
such
as
vultures
,
eagles
,
and
buzzards
,
but
also
storks
.
These
birds
migrate
in
the
daytime
.
Migratory
species
in
these
groups
have
great
difficulty
crossing
large
bodies
of
water
,
since
thermals
only
form
over
land
,
and
these
birds
cannot
maintain
active
flight
for
long
distances
.
Mediterranean
and
other
seas
present
a
major
obstacle
to
soaring
birds
,
which
must
cross
at
the
narrowest
points
.
Massive
numbers
of
large
raptors
and
storks
pass
through
areas
such
as
the
Strait
of
Messina
,
Gibraltar
,
Falsterbo
,
and
the
Bosphorus
at
migration
times
.
More
common
species
,
such
as
the
European
honey
buzzard
Pernis
apivorus
,
can
be
counted
in
hundreds
of
thousands
in
autumn
.
Other
barriers
,
such
as
mountain
ranges
,
can
also
cause
funnelling
,
particularly
of
large
diurnal
migrants
.
This
is
a
notable
factor
in
the
Central
American
migratory
bottleneck
.
Batumi
bottleneck
in
the
Caucasus
is
one
of
the
heaviest
migratory
funnels
on
earth
.
Avoiding
flying
over
the
Black
Sea
surface
and
across
high
mountains
,
hundreds
of
thousands
of
soaring
birds
funnel
through
an
area
around
the
city
of
Batumi
,
Georgia
.
Birds
of
prey
such
as
honey
buzzards
which
migrate
using
thermals
lose
only
10
to
20
%
of
their
weight
during
migration
,
which
may
explain
why
they
forage
less
during
migration
than
do
smaller
birds
of
prey
with
more
active
flight
such
as
falcons
,
hawks
and
harriers
.
Many
of
the
smaller
insectivorous
birds
including
the
warblers
,
hummingbirds
and
flycatchers
migrate
large
distances
,
usually
at
night
.
They
land
in
the
morning
and
may
feed
for
a
few
days
before
resuming
their
migration
.
The
birds
are
referred
to
as
passage
migrants
in
the
regions
where
they
occur
for
short
durations
between
the
origin
and
destination
.
Nocturnal
migrants
minimize
predation
,
avoid
overheating
,
and
can
feed
during
the
day
.
One
cost
of
nocturnal
migration
is
the
loss
of
sleep
.
Migrants
may
be
able
to
alter
their
quality
of
sleep
to
compensate
for
the
loss
.
Many
long-distance
migrants
appear
to
be
genetically
programmed
to
respond
to
changing
day
length
.
Species
that
move
short
distances
,
however
,
may
not
need
such
a
timing
mechanism
,
instead
moving
in
response
to
local
weather
conditions
.
Thus
mountain
and
moorland
breeders
,
such
as
wallcreeper
Tichodroma
muraria
and
white
-
throated
dipper
Cinclus
cinclus
,
may
move
only
altitudinally
to
escape
the
cold
higher
ground
.
Other
species
such
as
merlin
Falco
columbarius
and
Eurasian
skylark
Alauda
arvensis
move
further
,
to
the
coast
or
towards
the
south
.
Species
like
the
chaffinch
are
much
less
migratory
in
Britain
than
those
of
continental
Europe
,
mostly
not
moving
more
than
5
km
in
their
lives
.
Short
-
distance
passerine
migrants
have
two
evolutionary
origins
.
Those
that
have
long-distance
migrants
in
the
same
family
,
such
as
the
common
chiffchaff
Phylloscopus
collybita
,
are
species
of
southern
hemisphere
origins
that
have
progressively
shortened
their
return
migration
to
stay
in
the
northern
hemisphere
.
Species
that
have
no
long-distance
migratory
relatives
,
such
as
the
waxwings
Bombycilla
,
are
effectively
moving
in
response
to
winter
weather
and
the
loss
of
their
usual
winter
food
,
rather
than
enhanced
breeding
opportunities
.
In
the
tropics
there
is
little
variation
in
the
length
of
day
throughout
the
year
,
and
it
is
always
warm
enough
for
a
food
supply
,
but
altitudinal
migration
occurs
in
some
tropical
birds
.
There
is
evidence
that
this
enables
the
migrants
to
obtain
more
of
their
preferred
foods
such
as
fruits
.
Sometimes
circumstances
such
as
a
good
breeding
season
followed
by
a
food
source
failure
the
following
year
lead
to
irruptions
in
which
large
numbers
of
a
species
move
far
beyond
the
normal
range
.
Bohemian
waxwings
Bombycilla
garrulus
well
show
this
unpredictable
variation
in
annual
numbers
,
with
five
major
arrivals
in
Britain
during
the
nineteenth
century
,
but
18
between
the
years
1937
and
2000
.
Red
crossbills
Loxia
curvirostra
too
are
irruptive
,
with
widespread
invasions
across
England
noted
in
1251
,
1593
,
1757
,
and
1791
.
Bird
migration
is
primarily
,
but
not
entirely
,
a
Northern
Hemisphere
phenomenon
.
This
is
because
land
birds
in
high
northern
latitudes
,
where
food
becomes
scarce
in
winter
,
leave
for
areas
further
south
(
including
the
Southern
Hemisphere
)
to
overwinter
,
and
because
the
continental
landmass
is
much
larger
in
the
Northern
Hemisphere
.
In
contrast
,
among
(
pelagic
)
seabirds
,
species
of
the
Southern
Hemisphere
are
more
likely
to
migrate
.
This
is
because
there
is
a
large
area
of
ocean
in
the
Southern
Hemisphere
,
and
more
islands
suitable
for
seabirds
to
nest
.
The
control
of
migration
,
its
timing
and
response
are
genetically
controlled
and
appear
to
be
a
primitive
trait
that
is
present
even
in
non-migratory
species
of
birds
.
The
ability
to
navigate
and
orient
themselves
during
migration
is
a
much
more
complex
phenomenon
that
may
include
both
endogenous
programs
as
well
as
learning
.
The
primary
physiological
cue
for
migration
are
the
changes
in
the
day
length
.
These
changes
are
also
related
to
hormonal
changes
in
the
birds
.
In
the
period
before
migration
,
many
birds
display
higher
activity
or
Zugunruhe
(
German
:
migratory
restlessness
)
,
first
described
by
Johann
Friedrich
Naumann
in
1795
,
as
well
as
physiological
changes
such
as
increased
fat
deposition
.
The
occurrence
of
Zugunruhe
even
in
cage-raised
birds
with
no
environmental
cues
(
e.g.
shortening
of
day
and
falling
temperature
)
has
pointed
to
the
role
of
circannual
endogenous
programs
in
controlling
bird
migrations
.
Caged
birds
display
a
preferential
flight
direction
that
corresponds
with
the
migratory
direction
they
would
take
in
nature
,
changing
their
preferential
direction
at
roughly
the
same
time
their
wild
conspecifics
change
course
.
In
polygynous
species
with
considerable
sexual
dimorphism
,
males
tend
to
return
earlier
to
the
breeding
sites
than
their
females
.
This
is
termed
protandry
.
Navigation
is
based
on
a
variety
of
senses
.
Many
birds
have
been
shown
to
use
a
sun
compass
.
Using
the
sun
for
direction
involves
the
need
for
making
compensation
based
on
the
time
.
Navigation
has
also
been
shown
to
be
based
on
a
combination
of
other
abilities
including
the
ability
to
detect
magnetic
fields
(
magnetoception
)
,
use
visual
landmarks
as
well
as
olfactory
cues
.
Long
distance
migrants
are
believed
to
disperse
as
young
birds
and
form
attachments
to
potential
breeding
sites
and
to
favourite
wintering
sites
.
Once
the
site
attachment
is
made
they
show
high
site-fidelity
,
visiting
the
same
wintering
sites
year
after
year
.
The
ability
of
birds
to
navigate
during
migrations
cannot
be
fully
explained
by
endogenous
programming
,
even
with
the
help
of
responses
to
environmental
cues
.
The
ability
to
successfully
perform
long-distance
migrations
can
probably
only
be
fully
explained
with
an
accounting
for
the
cognitive
ability
of
the
birds
to
recognize
habitats
and
form
mental
maps
.
Satellite
tracking
of
day
migrating
raptors
such
as
ospreys
and
honey
buzzards
has
shown
that
older
individuals
are
better
at
making
corrections
for
wind
drift
.
Migratory
birds
may
use
two
electromagnetic
tools
to
find
their
destinations
:
one
that
is
entirely
innate
and
another
that
relies
on
experience
.
A
young
bird
on
its
first
migration
flies
in
the
correct
direction
according
to
the
Earth
's
magnetic
field
,
but
does
not
know
how
far
the
journey
will
be
.
It
does
this
through
a
radical
pair
mechanism
whereby
chemical
reactions
in
special
photo
pigments
sensitive
to
long
wavelengths
are
affected
by
the
field
.
Although
this
only
works
during
daylight
hours
,
it
does
not
use
the
position
of
the
sun
in
any
way
.
At
this
stage
the
bird
is
in
the
position
of
a
boy
scout
with
a
compass
but
no
map
,
until
it
grows
accustomed
to
the
journey
and
can
put
its
other
capabilities
to
use
.
With
experience
it
learns
various
landmarks
and
this
"
mapping
"
is
done
by
magnetites
in
the
trigeminal
system
,
which
tell
the
bird
how
strong
the
field
is
.
Because
birds
migrate
between
northern
and
southern
regions
,
the
magnetic
field
strengths
at
different
latitudes
let
it
interpret
the
radical
pair
mechanism
more
accurately
and
let
it
know
when
it
has
reached
its
destination
.
There
is
a
neural
connection
between
the
eye
and
"
Cluster
N
"
,
the
part
of
the
forebrain
that
is
active
during
migrational
orientation
,
suggesting
that
birds
may
actually
be
able
to
see
the
magnetic
field
of
the
earth
.
Migrating
birds
can
lose
their
way
and
appear
outside
their
normal
ranges
.
This
can
be
due
to
flying
past
their
destinations
as
in
the
"
spring
overshoot
"
in
which
birds
returning
to
their
breeding
areas
overshoot
and
end
up
further
north
than
intended
.
Certain
areas
,
because
of
their
location
,
have
become
famous
as
watchpoints
for
such
birds
.
Examples
are
the
Point
Pelee
National
Park
in
Canada
,
and
Spurn
in
England
.
Reverse
migration
,
where
the
genetic
programming
of
young
birds
fails
to
work
properly
,
can
lead
to
rarities
turning
up
as
vagrants
thousands
of
kilometres
out
of
range
.
A
related
phenomenon
called
"
abmigration
"
involves
birds
from
one
region
joining
similar
birds
from
a
different
breeding
region
in
the
common
winter
grounds
and
then
migrating
back
along
with
the
new
population
.
This
is
especially
common
in
some
waterfowl
,
which
shift
from
one
flyway
to
another
.
It
has
been
possible
to
teach
a
migration
route
to
a
flock
of
birds
,
for
example
in
re-introduction
schemes
.
After
a
trial
with
Canada
geese
Branta
canadensis
,
microlight
aircraft
were
used
in
the
US
to
teach
safe
migration
routes
to
reintroduced
whooping
cranes
Grus
americana
.
Birds
need
to
alter
their
metabolism
in
order
to
meet
the
demands
of
migration
.
The
storage
of
energy
through
the
accumulation
of
fat
and
the
control
of
sleep
in
nocturnal
migrants
require
special
physiological
adaptations
.
In
addition
,
the
feathers
of
a
bird
suffer
from
wear
-
and
-
tear
and
require
to
be
molted
.
The
timing
of
this
molt
-
usually
once
a
year
but
sometimes
twice
-
varies
with
some
species
molting
prior
to
moving
to
their
winter
grounds
and
others
molting
prior
to
returning
to
their
breeding
grounds
.
Apart
from
physiological
adaptations
,
migration
sometimes
requires
behavioural
changes
such
as
flying
in
flocks
to
reduce
the
energy
used
in
migration
or
the
risk
of
predation
.
Migration
in
birds
is
highly
labile
and
is
believed
to
have
developed
independently
in
many
avian
lineages
.
While
it
is
agreed
that
the
behavioral
and
physiological
adaptations
necessary
for
migration
are
under
genetic
control
,
some
authors
have
argued
that
no
genetic
change
is
necessary
for
migratory
behavior
to
develop
in
a
sedentary
species
because
the
genetic
framework
for
migratory
behavior
exists
in
nearly
all
avian
lineages
.
This
explains
the
rapid
appearance
of
migratory
behavior
after
the
most
recent
glacial
maximum
.
Theoretical
analyses
show
that
detours
that
increase
flight
distance
by
up
to
20
%
will
often
be
adaptive
on
aerodynamic
grounds
-
a
bird
that
loads
itself
with
food
to
cross
a
long
barrier
flies
less
efficiently
.
However
some
species
show
circuitous
migratory
routes
that
reflect
historical
range
expansions
and
are
far
from
optimal
in
ecological
terms
.
An
example
is
the
migration
of
continental
populations
of
Swainson
's
thrush
Catharus
ustulatus
,
which
fly
far
east
across
North
America
before
turning
south
via
Florida
to
reach
northern
South
America
;
this
route
is
believed
to
be
the
consequence
of
a
range
expansion
that
occurred
about
10,000
years
ago
.
Detours
may
also
be
caused
by
differential
wind
conditions
,
predation
risk
,
or
other
factors
.
Large
scale
climatic
changes
,
as
have
been
experienced
in
the
past
,
are
expected
to
have
an
effect
on
the
timing
of
migration
.
Studies
have
shown
a
variety
of
effects
including
timing
changes
in
migration
,
breeding
as
well
as
population
variations
.
The
migration
of
birds
also
aids
the
movement
of
other
species
,
including
those
of
ectoparasites
such
as
ticks
and
lice
,
which
in
turn
may
carry
micro-organisms
including
those
of
concern
to
human
health
.
Due
to
the
global
spread
of
avian
influenza
,
bird
migration
has
been
studied
as
a
possible
mechanism
of
disease
transmission
,
but
it
has
been
found
not
to
present
a
special
risk
;
import
of
pet
and
domestic
birds
is
a
greater
threat
.
Some
viruses
that
are
maintained
in
birds
without
lethal
effects
,
such
as
the
West
Nile
Virus
may
however
be
spread
by
migrating
birds
.
Birds
may
also
have
a
role
in
the
dispersal
of
propagules
of
plants
and
plankton
.
Some
predators
take
advantage
of
the
concentration
of
birds
during
migration
.
Greater
noctule
bats
feed
on
nocturnal
migrating
passerines
.
Some
birds
of
prey
specialize
on
migrating
waders
.
Bird
migration
routes
have
been
studied
by
a
variety
of
techniques
including
the
oldest
,
marking
.
Swans
have
been
marked
with
a
nick
on
the
beak
since
about
1560
in
England
.
Scientific
ringing
was
pioneered
by
Hans
Christian
Cornelius
Mortensen
in
1899
.
Other
techniques
include
radar
and
satellite
tracking
.
Orientation
behaviour
studies
have
been
traditionally
carried
out
using
variants
of
a
setup
known
as
the
Emlen
funnel
,
which
consists
of
a
circular
cage
with
the
top
covered
by
glass
or
wire
-screen
so
that
either
the
sky
is
visible
or
the
setup
is
placed
in
a
planetarium
or
with
other
controls
on
environmental
cues
.
The
orientation
behaviour
of
the
bird
inside
the
cage
is
studied
quantitatively
using
the
distribution
of
marks
that
the
bird
leaves
on
the
walls
of
the
cage
.
Other
approaches
used
in
pigeon
homing
studies
make
use
of
the
direction
in
which
the
bird
vanishes
on
the
horizon
.
Hunting
along
migration
routes
threatens
some
bird
species
.
The
populations
of
Siberian
cranes
(
Leucogeranus
leucogeranus
)
that
wintered
in
India
declined
due
to
hunting
along
the
route
,
particularly
in
Afghanistan
and
Central
Asia
.
Birds
were
last
seen
in
their
favourite
wintering
grounds
in
Keoladeo
National
Park
in
2002
.
Structures
such
as
power
lines
,
wind
farms
and
offshore
oil-rigs
have
also
been
known
to
affect
migratory
birds
.
Other
migration
hazards
include
pollution
,
storms
,
wildfires
,
and
habitat
destruction
along
migration
routes
,
denying
migrants
food
at
stopover
points
.
For
example
,
in
the
East
Asian
–Australasian
Flyway
,
up
to
65
%
of
key
intertidal
habitat
at
the
Yellow
Sea
migration
bottleneck
has
been
destroyed
since
the
1950s
.
Immunology
is
a
branch
of
biomedical
science
that
covers
the
study
of
immune
systems
in
all
organisms
.
It
charts
,
measures
,
and
contextualizes
the
:
physiological
functioning
of
the
immune
system
in
states
of
both
health
and
diseases
;
malfunctions
of
the
immune
system
in
immunological
disorders
(
such
as
autoimmune
diseases
,
hypersensitivities
,
immune
deficiency
,
and
transplant
rejection
)
;
the
physical
,
chemical
and
physiological
characteristics
of
the
components
of
the
immune
system
in
vitro
,
in
situ
,
and
in
vivo
.
Immunology
has
applications
in
numerous
disciplines
of
medicine
,
particularly
in
the
fields
of
organ
transplantation
,
oncology
,
virology
,
bacteriology
,
parasitology
,
psychiatry
,
and
dermatology
.
Prior
to
the
designation
of
immunity
from
the
etymological
root
immunis
,
which
is
Latin
for
"
exempt
"
;
early
physicians
characterized
organs
that
would
later
be
proven
as
essential
components
of
the
immune
system
.
The
important
lymphoid
organs
of
the
immune
system
are
the
thymus
and
bone
marrow
,
and
chief
lymphatic
tissues
such
as
spleen
,
tonsils
,
lymph
vessels
,
lymph
nodes
,
adenoids
,
and
liver
.
When
health
conditions
worsen
to
emergency
status
,
portions
of
immune
system
organs
including
the
thymus
,
spleen
,
bone
marrow
,
lymph
nodes
and
other
lymphatic
tissues
can
be
surgically
excised
for
examination
while
patients
are
still
alive
.
Many
components
of
the
immune
system
are
typically
cellular
in
nature
and
not
associated
with
any
specific
organ
;
but
rather
are
embedded
or
circulating
in
various
tissues
located
throughout
the
body
.
Classical
immunology
ties
in
with
the
fields
of
epidemiology
and
medicine
.
It
studies
the
relationship
between
the
body
systems
,
pathogens
,
and
immunity
.
The
earliest
written
mention
of
immunity
can
be
traced
back
to
the
plague
of
Athens
in
430
BCE
.
Thucydides
noted
that
people
who
had
recovered
from
a
previous
bout
of
the
disease
could
nurse
the
sick
without
contracting
the
illness
a
second
time
.
Many
other
ancient
societies
have
references
to
this
phenomenon
,
but
it
was
not
until
the
19th
and
20th
centuries
before
the
concept
developed
into
scientific
theory
.
The
study
of
the
molecular
and
cellular
components
that
comprise
the
immune
system
,
including
their
function
and
interaction
,
is
the
central
science
of
immunology
.
The
immune
system
has
been
divided
into
a
more
primitive
innate
immune
system
and
,
in
vertebrates
,
an
acquired
or
adaptive
immune
system
.
The
latter
is
further
divided
into
humoral
(
or
antibody
)
and
cell-mediated
components
.
The
humoral
(
antibody
)
response
is
defined
as
the
interaction
between
antibodies
and
antigens
.
Antibodies
are
specific
proteins
released
from
a
certain
class
of
immune
cells
known
as
B
lymphocytes
,
while
antigens
are
defined
as
anything
that
elicits
the
generation
of
antibodies
(
"
anti"
body
"
gen"
erators
)
.
Immunology
rests
on
an
understanding
of
the
properties
of
these
two
biological
entities
and
the
cellular
response
to
both
.
Immunological
research
continues
to
become
more
specialized
,
pursuing
non-classical
models
of
immunity
and
functions
of
cells
,
organs
and
systems
not
previously
associated
with
the
immune
system
(
Yemeserach
2010
)
.
Clinical
immunology
is
the
study
of
diseases
caused
by
disorders
of
the
immune
system
(
failure
,
aberrant
action
,
and
malignant
growth
of
the
cellular
elements
of
the
system
)
.
It
also
involves
diseases
of
other
systems
,
where
immune
reactions
play
a
part
in
the
pathology
and
clinical
features
.
Other
immune
system
disorders
include
various
hypersensitivities
(
such
as
in
asthma
and
other
allergies
)
that
respond
inappropriately
to
otherwise
harmless
compounds
.
The
most
well
-
known
disease
that
affects
the
immune
system
itself
is
AIDS
,
an
immunodeficiency
characterized
by
the
suppression
of
CD4
+
(
"
helper
"
)
T
cells
,
dendritic
cells
and
macrophages
by
the
Human
Immunodeficiency
Virus
(
HIV
)
.
The
body
’s
capability
to
react
to
antigen
depends
on
a
person
's
age
,
antigen
type
,
maternal
factors
and
the
area
where
the
antigen
is
presented
.
Neonates
are
said
to
be
in
a
state
of
physiological
immunodeficiency
,
because
both
their
innate
and
adaptive
immunological
responses
are
greatly
suppressed
.
Once
born
,
a
child
’s
immune
system
responds
favorably
to
protein
antigens
while
not
as
well
to
glycoproteins
and
polysaccharides
.
In
fact
,
many
of
the
infections
acquired
by
neonates
are
caused
by
low
virulence
organisms
like
Staphylococcus
and
Pseudomonas
.
In
neonates
,
opsonic
activity
and
the
ability
to
activate
the
complement
cascade
is
very
limited
.
For
example
,
the
mean
level
of
C3
in
a
newborn
is
approximately
65
%
of
that
found
in
the
adult
.
Phagocytic
activity
is
also
greatly
impaired
in
newborns
.
This
is
due
to
lower
opsonic
activity
,
as
well
as
diminished
up-regulation
of
integrin
and
selectin
receptors
,
which
limit
the
ability
of
neutrophils
to
interact
with
adhesion
molecules
in
the
endothelium
.
Their
monocytes
are
slow
and
have
a
reduced
ATP
production
,
which
also
limits
the
newborn
's
phagocytic
activity
.
Although
,
the
number
of
total
lymphocytes
is
significantly
higher
than
in
adults
,
the
cellular
and
humoral
immunity
is
also
impaired
.
Antigen
-
presenting
cells
in
newborns
have
a
reduced
capability
to
activate
T
cells
.
Also
,
T
cells
of
a
newborn
proliferate
poorly
and
produce
very
small
amounts
of
cytokines
like
IL
-2
,
IL
-4
,
IL
-5
,
IL
-
12
,
and
IFN
-
g
which
limits
their
capacity
to
activate
the
humoral
response
as
well
as
the
phagocitic
activity
of
macrophage
.
B
cells
develop
early
during
gestation
but
are
not
fully
active
.
Maternal
factors
also
play
a
role
in
the
body
’s
immune
response
.
At
birth
,
most
of
the
immunoglobulin
present
is
maternal
IgG
.
Because
IgM
,
IgD
,
IgE
and
IgA
do
n’t
cross
the
placenta
,
they
are
almost
undetectable
at
birth
.
Some
IgA
is
provided
by
breast
milk
.
These
passively
-
acquired
antibodies
can
protect
the
newborn
for
up
to
18
months
,
but
their
response
is
usually
short-
lived
and
of
low
affinity
.
These
antibodies
can
also
produce
a
negative
response
.
If
a
child
is
exposed
to
the
antibody
for
a
particular
antigen
before
being
exposed
to
the
antigen
itself
then
the
child
will
produce
a
dampened
response
.
Passively
acquired
maternal
antibodies
can
suppress
the
antibody
response
to
active
immunization
.
Similarly
the
response
of
T-cells
to
vaccination
differs
in
children
compared
to
adults
,
and
vaccines
that
induce
Th1
responses
in
adults
do
not
readily
elicit
these
same
responses
in
neonates
.
Between
six
to
nine
months
after
birth
,
a
child
’s
immune
system
begins
to
respond
more
strongly
to
glycoproteins
,
but
there
is
usually
no
marked
improvement
in
their
response
to
polysaccharides
until
they
are
at
least
one
year
old
.
This
can
be
the
reason
for
distinct
time
frames
found
in
vaccination
schedules
.
During
adolescence
,
the
human
body
undergoes
various
physical
,
physiological
and
immunological
changes
triggered
and
mediated
by
hormones
,
of
which
the
most
significant
in
females
is
17
-
β-
oestradiol
(
an
oestrogen
)
and
,
in
males
,
is
testosterone
.
Oestradiol
usually
begins
to
act
around
the
age
of
10
and
testosterone
some
months
later
.
There
is
evidence
that
these
steroids
act
directly
not
only
on
the
primary
and
secondary
sexual
characteristics
but
also
have
an
effect
on
the
development
and
regulation
of
the
immune
system
,
including
an
increased
risk
in
developing
pubescent
and
post-pubescent
autoimmunity
.
There
is
also
some
evidence
that
cell
surface
receptors
on
B
cells
and
macrophages
may
detect
sex
hormones
in
the
system
.
Immunology
is
strongly
experimental
in
everyday
practice
but
is
also
characterized
by
an
ongoing
theoretical
attitude
.
Many
theories
have
been
suggested
in
immunology
from
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
up
to
the
present
time
.
The
end
of
the
19th
century
and
the
beginning
of
the
20th
century
saw
a
battle
between
"
cellular
"
and
"
humoral
"
theories
of
immunity
.
According
to
the
cellular
theory
of
immunity
,
represented
in
particular
by
Elie
Metchnikoff
,
it
was
cells
–
more
precisely
,
phagocytes
–
that
were
responsible
for
immune
responses
.
In
contrast
,
the
humoral
theory
of
immunity
,
held
by
Robert
Koch
and
Emil
von
Behring
,
among
others
,
stated
that
the
active
immune
agents
were
soluble
components
(
molecules
)
found
in
the
organism
’s
“
humors
”
rather
than
its
cells
.
In
the
mid-1950s
,
Frank
Burnet
,
inspired
by
a
suggestion
made
by
Niels
Jerne
,
formulated
the
clonal
selection
theory
(
CST
)
of
immunity
.
On
the
basis
of
CST
,
Burnet
developed
a
theory
of
how
an
immune
response
is
triggered
according
to
the
self
/
nonself
distinction
:
"
self
"
constituents
(
constituents
of
the
body
)
do
not
trigger
destructive
immune
responses
,
while
"
nonself
"
entities
(
e.g.
,
pathogens
,
an
allograft
)
trigger
a
destructive
immune
response
.
The
theory
was
later
modified
to
reflect
new
discoveries
regarding
histocompatibility
or
the
complex
"
two-signal
"
activation
of
T
cells
.
The
self
/
nonself
theory
of
immunity
and
the
self
/
nonself
vocabulary
have
been
criticized
,
but
remain
very
influential
.
Bioscience
is
the
overall
major
in
which
undergraduate
students
who
are
interested
in
general
well
-
being
take
in
college
.
Immunology
is
a
branch
of
bioscience
for
undergraduate
programs
but
the
major
gets
specified
as
students
move
on
for
graduate
program
in
immunology
.
The
aim
of
immunology
is
to
study
the
health
of
humans
and
animals
through
effective
yet
consistent
research
,
(
AAAAI
,
2013
)
.
The
most
important
thing
about
being
immunologists
is
the
research
because
it
is
the
biggest
portion
of
their
jobs
.
Most
graduate
immunology
schools
follow
the
AAI
courses
immunology
which
are
offered
throughout
numerous
schools
in
the
United
States
.
For
example
,
in
New
York
State
,
there
are
several
universities
that
offer
the
AAI
courses
immunology
:
Albany
Medical
College
,
Cornell
University
,
Icahn
School
of
Medicine
at
Mount
Sinai
,
New
York
University
Langone
Medical
Center
,
University
at
Albany
(
SUNY
)
,
University
at
Buffalo
(
SUNY
)
,
University
of
Rochester
Medical
Center
and
Upstate
Medical
University
(
SUNY
)
.
The
AAI
immunology
courses
include
an
Introductory
Course
and
an
Advance
Course
.
The
Introductory
Course
is
a
course
that
gives
students
an
overview
of
the
basics
of
immunology
.
In
addition
,
this
Introductory
Course
gives
students
more
information
to
complement
general
biology
or
science
training
.
It
also
has
two
different
parts
:
Part
I
is
an
introduction
to
the
basic
principles
of
immunology
and
Part
II
is
a
clinically
-
oriented
lecture
series
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
Advanced
Course
is
another
course
for
those
who
are
willing
to
expand
or
update
their
understanding
of
immunology
.
It
is
advised
for
students
who
want
to
attend
the
Advanced
Course
to
have
a
background
of
the
principles
of
immunology
.
Most
schools
require
students
to
take
electives
in
other
to
complete
their
degrees
.
A
Master
’s
degree
requires
two
years
of
study
following
the
attainment
of
a
bachelor
's
degree
.
For
a
doctoral
programme
it
is
required
to
take
two
additional
years
of
study
.
Hoover
began
using
wiretapping
in
the
1920s
during
Prohibition
to
arrest
bootleggers
.
In
the
1927
case
Olmstead
v.
United
States
,
in
which
a
bootlegger
was
caught
through
telephone
tapping
,
the
United
States
Supreme
Court
ruled
that
FBI
wiretaps
did
not
violate
the
Fourth
Amendment
as
unlawful
search
and
seizure
,
as
long
as
the
FBI
did
not
break
into
a
person
's
home
to
complete
the
tapping
.
After
Prohibition
's
repeal
,
Congress
passed
the
Communications
Act
of
1934
,
which
outlawed
non-consensual
phone
tapping
,
but
allowed
bugging
.
In
the
1939
case
Nardone
v.
United
States
,
the
court
ruled
that
due
to
the
1934
law
,
evidence
the
FBI
obtained
by
phone
tapping
was
inadmissible
in
court
.
After
the
1967
case
Katz
v.
United
States
overturned
the
1927
case
that
had
allowed
bugging
,
Congress
passed
the
Omnibus
Crime
Control
Act
,
allowing
public
authorities
to
tap
telephones
during
investigations
as
long
as
they
obtain
a
warrant
beforehand
.
In
March
1971
,
the
residential
office
of
an
FBI
agent
in
Media
,
Pennsylvania
was
burglarized
by
a
group
calling
itself
the
Citizens
'
Commission
to
Investigate
the
FBI
.
Numerous
files
were
taken
and
distributed
to
a
range
of
newspapers
,
including
The
Harvard
Crimson
.
The
files
detailed
the
FBI
's
extensive
COINTELPRO
program
,
which
included
investigations
into
lives
of
ordinary
citizens
—
including
a
black
student
group
at
a
Pennsylvania
military
college
and
the
daughter
of
Congressman
Henry
Reuss
of
Wisconsin
.
The
country
was
"
jolted
"
by
the
revelations
,
which
included
assassinations
of
political
activists
,
and
the
actions
were
denounced
by
members
of
Congress
,
including
House
Majority
Leader
Hale
Boggs
.
The
phones
of
some
members
of
Congress
,
including
Boggs
,
had
allegedly
been
tapped
.
From
the
end
of
the
1980s
to
the
early
1990s
,
the
FBI
reassigned
more
than
300
agents
from
foreign
counter
-
intelligence
duties
to
violent
crime
,
and
made
violent
crime
the
sixth
national
priority
.
With
reduced
cuts
to
other
well
-
established
departments
,
and
because
terrorism
was
no
longer
considered
a
threat
after
the
end
of
the
Cold
War
,
the
FBI
assisted
local
and
state
police
forces
in
tracking
fugitives
who
had
crossed
state
lines
,
which
is
a
federal
offense
.
The
FBI
Laboratory
helped
develop
DNA
testing
,
continuing
its
pioneering
role
in
identification
that
began
with
its
fingerprinting
system
in
1924
.
The
9/11
Commission
's
final
report
on
July
22
,
2004
stated
that
the
FBI
and
Central
Intelligence
Agency
(
CIA
)
were
both
partially
to
blame
for
not
pursuing
intelligence
reports
that
could
have
prevented
the
September
11
,
2001
attacks
.
In
its
most
damning
assessment
,
the
report
concluded
that
the
country
had
"
not
been
well
served
"
by
either
agency
and
listed
numerous
recommendations
for
changes
within
the
FBI
.
While
the
FBI
has
acceded
to
most
of
the
recommendations
,
including
oversight
by
the
new
Director
of
National
Intelligence
,
some
former
members
of
the
9/11
Commission
publicly
criticized
the
FBI
in
October
2005
,
claiming
it
was
resisting
any
meaningful
changes
.
The
Criminal
Justice
Information
Services
(
CJIS
)
Division
,
is
located
in
Clarksburg
,
West
Virginia
.
Organized
beginning
in
1991
,
the
office
opened
in
1995
as
the
youngest
agency
division
.
The
complex
is
the
length
of
three
football
fields
.
It
provides
a
main
repository
for
information
in
various
data
systems
.
Under
the
roof
of
the
CJIS
are
the
programs
for
the
National
Crime
Information
Center
(
NCIC
)
,
Uniform
Crime
Reporting
(
UCR
)
,
Fingerprint
Identification
,
Integrated
Automated
Fingerprint
Identification
System
(
IAFIS
)
,
NCIC
2000
,
and
the
National
Incident
-
Based
Reporting
System
(
NIBRS
)
.
Many
state
and
local
agencies
use
these
data
systems
as
a
source
for
their
own
investigations
and
contribute
to
the
database
using
secure
communications
.
FBI
provides
these
tools
of
sophisticated
identification
and
information
services
to
local
,
state
,
federal
,
and
international
law
enforcement
agencies
.
The
FBI
director
is
responsible
for
the
day-to
-
day
operations
at
the
FBI
.
Along
with
his
deputies
,
the
director
makes
sure
cases
and
operations
are
handled
correctly
.
The
director
also
is
in
charge
of
making
sure
the
leadership
in
any
one
of
the
FBI
field
offices
is
manned
with
qualified
agents
.
Before
the
Intelligence
Reform
and
Terrorism
Prevention
Act
was
passed
in
the
wake
of
the
September
11
attacks
,
the
FBI
director
would
directly
brief
the
President
of
the
United
States
on
any
issues
that
arise
from
within
the
FBI
.
Since
then
,
the
director
now
reports
to
the
Director
of
National
Intelligence
(
DNI
)
,
who
in
turn
reports
to
the
President
.
The
Uniform
Crime
Reports
(
UCR
)
compile
data
from
over
17,000
law
enforcement
agencies
across
the
country
.
They
provide
detailed
data
regarding
the
volume
of
crimes
to
include
arrest
,
clearance
(
or
closing
a
case
)
,
and
law
enforcement
officer
information
.
The
UCR
focuses
its
data
collection
on
violent
crimes
,
hate
crimes
,
and
property
crimes
.
Created
in
the
1920s
,
the
UCR
system
has
not
proven
to
be
as
uniform
as
its
name
implies
.
The
UCR
data
only
reflect
the
most
serious
offense
in
the
case
of
connected
crimes
and
has
a
very
restrictive
definition
of
rape
.
Since
about
93
%
of
the
data
submitted
to
the
FBI
is
in
this
format
,
the
UCR
stands
out
as
the
publication
of
choice
as
most
states
require
law
enforcement
agencies
to
submit
this
data
.
FBI
records
show
that
85
%
of
COINTELPRO
resources
targeted
groups
and
individuals
that
the
FBI
deemed
"
subversive
"
,
including
communist
and
socialist
organizations
;
organizations
and
individuals
associated
with
the
Civil
Rights
Movement
,
including
Martin
Luther
King
,
Jr.
and
others
associated
with
the
Southern
Christian
Leadership
Conference
,
the
National
Association
for
the
Advancement
of
Colored
People
,
and
the
Congress
of
Racial
Equality
and
other
civil
rights
organizations
;
black
nationalist
groups
;
the
American
Indian
Movement
;
a
broad
range
of
organizations
labeled
"
New
Left
"
,
including
Students
for
a
Democratic
Society
and
the
Weathermen
;
almost
all
groups
protesting
the
Vietnam
War
,
as
well
as
individual
student
demonstrators
with
no
group
affiliation
;
the
National
Lawyers
Guild
;
organizations
and
individuals
associated
with
the
women
's
rights
movement
;
nationalist
groups
such
as
those
seeking
independence
for
Puerto
Rico
,
United
Ireland
,
and
Cuban
exile
movements
including
Orlando
Bosch
's
Cuban
Power
and
the
Cuban
Nationalist
Movement
.
The
remaining
15
%
of
COINTELPRO
resources
were
expended
to
marginalize
and
subvert
white
hate
groups
,
including
the
Ku
Klux
Klan
and
the
National
States
'
Rights
Party
.
Although
many
of
FBI
's
functions
are
unique
,
its
activities
in
support
of
national
security
are
comparable
to
those
of
the
British
MI5
and
the
Russian
FSB
.
Unlike
the
Central
Intelligence
Agency
(
CIA
)
,
which
has
no
law
enforcement
authority
and
is
focused
on
intelligence
collection
overseas
,
FBI
is
primarily
a
domestic
agency
,
maintaining
56
field
offices
in
major
cities
throughout
the
United
States
,
and
more
than
400
resident
agencies
in
lesser
cities
and
areas
across
the
nation
.
At
an
FBI
field
office
,
a
senior-level
FBI
officer
concurrently
serves
as
the
representative
of
the
Director
of
National
Intelligence
.
The
bureau
's
first
official
task
was
visiting
and
making
surveys
of
the
houses
of
prostitution
in
preparation
for
enforcing
the
"
White
Slave
Traffic
Act
,
"
or
Mann
Act
,
passed
on
June
25
,
1910
.
In
1932
,
it
was
renamed
the
United
States
Bureau
of
Investigation
.
The
following
year
it
was
linked
to
the
Bureau
of
Prohibition
and
rechristened
the
Division
of
Investigation
(
DOI
)
before
finally
becoming
an
independent
service
within
the
Department
of
Justice
in
1935
.
In
the
same
year
,
its
name
was
officially
changed
from
the
Division
of
Investigation
to
the
present-
day
Federal
Bureau
of
Investigation
,
or
FBI
.
During
the
1950s
and
1960s
,
FBI
officials
became
increasingly
concerned
about
the
influence
of
civil
rights
leaders
,
whom
they
believed
had
communist
ties
or
were
unduly
influenced
by
them
.
In
1956
,
for
example
,
Hoover
sent
an
open
letter
denouncing
Dr.
T.R.M
.
Howard
,
a
civil
rights
leader
,
surgeon
,
and
wealthy
entrepreneur
in
Mississippi
who
had
criticized
FBI
inaction
in
solving
recent
murders
of
George
W.
Lee
,
Emmett
Till
,
and
other
blacks
in
the
South
.
The
FBI
carried
out
controversial
domestic
surveillance
in
an
operation
it
called
the
COINTELPRO
,
which
was
short
for
"
COunter-INTELligence
PROgram
.
"
It
was
to
investigate
and
disrupt
the
activities
of
dissident
political
organizations
within
the
United
States
,
including
both
militant
and
non-violent
organizations
.
Among
its
targets
was
the
Southern
Christian
Leadership
Conference
,
a
leading
civil
rights
organization
with
clergy
leadership
.
Beginning
in
the
1940s
and
continuing
into
the
1970s
,
the
bureau
investigated
cases
of
espionage
against
the
United
States
and
its
allies
.
Eight
Nazi
agents
who
had
planned
sabotage
operations
against
American
targets
were
arrested
,
and
six
were
executed
(
Ex
parte
Quirin
)
under
their
sentences
.
Also
during
this
time
,
a
joint
US
/
UK
code-breaking
effort
(
the
Venona
project
)
—
with
which
the
FBI
was
heavily
involved
—
broke
Soviet
diplomatic
and
intelligence
communications
codes
,
allowing
the
US
and
British
governments
to
read
Soviet
communications
.
This
effort
confirmed
the
existence
of
Americans
working
in
the
United
States
for
Soviet
intelligence
.
Hoover
was
administering
this
project
but
failed
to
notify
the
Central
Intelligence
Agency
(
CIA
)
until
1952
.
Another
notable
case
is
the
arrest
of
Soviet
spy
Rudolf
Abel
in
1957
.
The
discovery
of
Soviet
spies
operating
in
the
US
allowed
Hoover
to
pursue
his
longstanding
obsession
with
the
threat
he
perceived
from
the
American
Left
,
ranging
from
Communist
Party
of
the
United
States
of
America
(
CPUSA
)
union
organizers
to
American
liberals
.
In
2003
a
congressional
committee
called
the
FBI
's
organized
crime
informant
program
"
one
of
the
greatest
failures
in
the
history
of
federal
law
enforcement
.
"
The
FBI
allowed
four
innocent
men
to
be
convicted
of
the
March
1965
gangland
murder
of
Edward
"
Teddy
"
Deegan
in
order
to
protect
Vincent
Flemmi
,
an
FBI
informant
.
Three
of
the
men
were
sentenced
to
death
(
which
was
later
reduced
to
life
in
prison
)
,
and
the
fourth
defendant
was
sentenced
to
life
in
prison
.
Two
of
the
four
men
died
in
prison
after
serving
almost
30
years
,
and
two
others
were
released
after
serving
32
and
36
years
.
In
July
2007
,
U.S.
District
Judge
Nancy
Gertner
in
Boston
found
the
bureau
helped
convict
the
four
men
using
false
witness
account
by
mobster
Joseph
Barboza
.
The
U.S.
Government
was
ordered
to
pay
$
100
million
in
damages
to
the
four
defendants
.
Between
1993
and
1996
,
the
FBI
increased
its
counter-terrorism
role
in
the
wake
of
the
first
1993
World
Trade
Center
bombing
in
New
York
City
,
New
York
;
the
1995
Oklahoma
City
bombing
in
Oklahoma
City
,
Oklahoma
;
and
the
arrest
of
the
Unabomber
in
1996
.
Technological
innovation
and
the
skills
of
FBI
Laboratory
analysts
helped
ensure
that
the
three
cases
were
successfully
prosecuted
.
Justice
Department
investigations
into
the
FBI
's
roles
in
the
Ruby
Ridge
and
Waco
incidents
were
found
to
be
obstructed
by
agents
within
the
Bureau
.
During
the
1996
Summer
Olympics
in
Atlanta
,
Georgia
,
the
FBI
was
criticized
for
its
investigation
of
the
Centennial
Olympic
Park
bombing
.
It
has
settled
a
dispute
with
Richard
Jewell
,
who
was
a
private
security
guard
at
the
venue
,
along
with
some
media
organizations
,
in
regard
to
the
leaking
of
his
name
during
the
investigation
.
During
the
September
11
,
2001
attacks
on
the
World
Trade
Center
,
FBI
agent
Leonard
W.
Hatton
Jr.
was
killed
during
the
rescue
effort
while
helping
the
rescue
personnel
evacuate
the
occupants
of
the
South
Tower
and
stayed
when
it
collapsed
.
Within
months
after
the
attacks
,
FBI
Director
Robert
Mueller
,
who
had
been
sworn
in
a
week
before
the
attacks
,
called
for
a
re-engineering
of
FBI
structure
and
operations
.
He
made
countering
every
federal
crime
a
top
priority
,
including
the
prevention
of
terrorism
,
countering
foreign
intelligence
operations
,
addressing
cyber
security
threats
,
other
high
-
tech
crimes
,
protecting
civil
rights
,
combating
public
corruption
,
organized
crime
,
white
-
collar
crime
,
and
major
acts
of
violent
crime
.
On
July
8
,
2007
The
Washington
Post
published
excerpts
from
UCLA
Professor
Amy
Zegart
's
book
Spying
Blind
:
The
CIA
,
the
FBI
,
and
the
Origins
of
9/11
.
The
Post
reported
from
Zegart
's
book
that
government
documents
show
the
CIA
and
FBI
missed
23
potential
chances
to
disrupt
the
terrorist
attacks
of
September
11
,
2001
.
The
primary
reasons
for
the
failures
included
:
agency
cultures
resistant
to
change
and
new
ideas
;
inappropriate
incentives
for
promotion
;
and
a
lack
of
cooperation
between
the
FBI
,
CIA
and
the
rest
of
the
United
States
Intelligence
Community
.
The
book
blamed
the
FBI
's
decentralized
structure
,
which
prevented
effective
communication
and
cooperation
among
different
FBI
offices
.
The
book
suggested
that
the
FBI
has
not
evolved
into
an
effective
counter-terrorism
or
counter
-
intelligence
agency
,
due
in
large
part
to
deeply
ingrained
agency
cultural
resistance
to
change
.
For
example
,
FBI
personnel
practices
continue
to
treat
all
staff
other
than
special
agents
as
support
staff
,
classifying
intelligence
analysts
alongside
the
FBI
's
auto
mechanics
and
janitors
.
The
USA
PATRIOT
Act
increased
the
powers
allotted
to
the
FBI
,
especially
in
wiretapping
and
monitoring
of
Internet
activity
.
One
of
the
most
controversial
provisions
of
the
act
is
the
so-called
sneak
and
peek
provision
,
granting
the
FBI
powers
to
search
a
house
while
the
residents
are
away
,
and
not
requiring
them
to
notify
the
residents
for
several
weeks
afterwards
.
Under
the
PATRIOT
Act
's
provisions
,
the
FBI
also
resumed
inquiring
into
the
library
records
of
those
who
are
suspected
of
terrorism
(
something
it
had
supposedly
not
done
since
the
1970s
)
.
The
FBI
Laboratory
,
established
with
the
formation
of
the
BOI
,
did
not
appear
in
the
J.
Edgar
Hoover
Building
until
its
completion
in
1974
.
The
lab
serves
as
the
primary
lab
for
most
DNA
,
biological
,
and
physical
work
.
Public
tours
of
FBI
headquarters
ran
through
the
FBI
laboratory
workspace
before
the
move
to
the
J.
Edgar
Hoover
Building
.
The
services
the
lab
conducts
include
Chemistry
,
Combined
DNA
Index
System
(
CODIS
)
,
Computer
Analysis
and
Response
,
DNA

.
The
services
of
the
FBI
Laboratory
are
used
by
many
state
,
local
,
and
international
agencies
free
of
charge
.
The
lab
also
maintains
a
second
lab
at
the
FBI
Academy
.
In
2000
,
the
FBI
began
the
Trilogy
project
to
upgrade
its
outdated
information
technology
(
IT
)
infrastructure
.
This
project
,
originally
scheduled
to
take
three
years
and
cost
around
$
380
million
,
ended
up
going
far
over
budget
and
behind
schedule
.
Efforts
to
deploy
modern
computers
and
networking
equipment
were
generally
successful
,
but
attempts
to
develop
new
investigation
software
,
outsourced
to
Science
Applications
International
Corporation
(
SAIC
)
,
were
not
.
Virtual
Case
File
,
or
VCF
,
as
the
software
was
known
,
was
plagued
by
poorly
defined
goals
,
and
repeated
changes
in
management
.
In
January
2005
,
more
than
two
years
after
the
software
was
originally
planned
for
completion
,
the
FBI
officially
abandoned
the
project
.
At
least
$
100
million
(
and
much
more
by
some
estimates
)
was
spent
on
the
project
,
which
never
became
operational
.
The
FBI
has
been
forced
to
continue
using
its
decade-old
Automated
Case
Support
system
,
which
IT
experts
consider
woefully
inadequate
.
In
March
2005
,
the
FBI
announced
it
was
beginning
a
new
,
more
ambitious
software
project
,
code-named
Sentinel
,
which
they
expected
to
complete
by
2009
.
An
FBI
special
agent
is
issued
a
Glock
Model
22
pistol
or
a
Glock
23
in
.40
S&W
caliber
.
If
they
fail
their
first
qualification
,
they
are
issued
either
a
Glock
17
or
Glock
19
,
to
aid
in
their
next
qualification
.
In
May
1997
,
the
FBI
officially
adopted
the
Glock
.40
S&W
pistol
for
general
agent
use
and
first
issued
it
to
New
Agent
Class
98
-
1
in
October
1997
.
At
present
,
the
Model
23
"
FG&R
"
(
finger
groove
and
rail
)
is
the
issue

.
New
agents
are
issued
firearms
,
on
which
they
must
qualify
,
on
successful
completion
of
their
training
at

are
authorized
to
purchase
and
qualify
with
the
Glock

in
.45
ACP
.
Special

required
.
All
FBI
employees
require
a
Top
Secret

Background
Investigations
(
SSBI
)
,
which
are
conducted
by
the

sit-ups
,
maximum
push-ups
,
and
a
1.5

The
FBI
has
maintained
files
on
numerous
people
,
including
celebrities
such
as
Elvis
Presley
,
Frank
Sinatra
,
John
Denver
,
John
Lennon
,
Jane

,
the
band
MC5
,
Lou
Costello
,
Sonny
Bono
,
Bob
Dylan
,
Michael
Jackson
,
and
Mickey
Mantle
.
The
files
were
collected
for
various
reasons
.
Some
of
the
subjects
were
investigated
for
alleged
ties
to
the
Communist
party
(
Charlie
Chaplin
and
Groucho

)
,
or
in
connection
with
antiwar
activities
during
the
Vietnam
War
(
John

)
.
Numerous
celebrity

.
In
December
1994
,
after
being
tipped
off
by
his
former
FBI
handler
about
a
pending
indictment
under
the
Racketeer
Influenced
and
Corrupt
Organizations
Act
,
Bulger
fled
Boston
and
went
into
hiding
.
For
16
years
,
he
remained
at
large
.
For
12
of
those
years
,
Bulger
was
prominently
listed
on
the
FBI
Ten
Most
Wanted
Fugitives
list
.
Beginning
in
1997
,
the
New
England
media
exposed
criminal
actions
by
federal
,
state
,
and
local
law
enforcement
officials
tied
to
Bulger
.
The
revelation
caused
great
embarrassment
to
the
FBI
.
In
2002
,
Special
Agent
John
J
Connolly
was
convicted
of
federal
racketeering
charges
for
helping
Bulger
avoid
arrest
.
In
2008
,
Special
Agent
Connolly
completed
his
term
on
the
federal
charges
and
was
transferred
to
Florida
where
he
was
convicted
of
helping
plan
the
murder
of
John
B
Callahan
,
a
Bulger
rival
.
In
2014
,
that
conviction
was
overturned
on
a
technicality
.
Connolly
was
the
agent
leading
the
investigation
of
Bulger
.
In
August
2007
Virgil
Griffith
,
a
Caltech
computation
and
neural-systems
graduate
student
,
created
a
searchable
database
that
linked
changes
made
by
anonymous
Wikipedia
editors
to
companies
and
organizations
from
which
the
changes
were
made
.
The
database
cross-referenced
logs
of
Wikipedia
edits
with
publicly
available
records
pertaining
to
the
internet
IP
addresses
edits
were
made
from
.
Griffith
was
motivated
by
the
edits
from
the
United
States
Congress
,
and
wanted
to
see
if
others
were
similarly
promoting
themselves
.
The
tool
was
designed
to
detect
conflict
of
interest
edits
.
Among
his
findings
were
that
FBI
computers
were
used
to
edit
the
FBI
article
in
Wikipedia
.
Although
the
edits
correlated
with
known
FBI
IP
addresses
,
there
was
no
proof
that
the
changes
actually
came
from
a
member
or
employee
of
the
FBI
,
only
that
someone
who
had
access
to
their
network
had
edited
the
FBI
article
in
Wikipedia
.
Wikipedia
spokespersons
received
Griffith
's
"
WikiScanner
"
positively
,
noting
that
it
helped
prevent
conflicts
of
interest
from
influencing
articles
as
well
as
increasing
transparency
and
mitigating
attempts
to
remove
or
distort
relevant
facts
.
On
20
February
2001
,
the
bureau
announced
that
a
special
agent
,
Robert
Hanssen
(
born
1944
)
had
been
arrested
for
spying
for
the
Soviet
Union
and
then
Russia
from
1979
to
2001
.
He
is
serving
15
consecutive
life
sentences
without
the
possibility
of
parole
at
ADX
Florence
,
a
federal
supermax
prison
near
Florence
,
Colorado
.
Hanssen
was
arrested
on
February
18
,
2001
at
Foxstone
Park
near
his
home
in
Vienna
,
Virginia
,
and
was
charged
with
selling
US
secrets
to
the
USSR
and
subsequently
Russia
for
more
than
US
$
1.4
million
in
cash
and
diamonds
over
a
22
-
year
period
.
On
July
6
,
2001
,
he
pleaded
guilty
to
15
counts
of
espionage
in
the
United
States
District
Court
for
the
Eastern
District
of
Virginia
.
His
spying
activities
have
been
described
by
the
US
Department
of
Justice
's
Commission
for
the
Review
of
FBI
Security
Programs
as
"
possibly
the
worst
intelligence
disaster
in
U.S.
history
"
.
The
Federal
Bureau
of
Investigation
(
FBI
)
is
the
domestic
intelligence
and
security
service
of
the
United
States
,
which
simultaneously
serves
as
the
nation
's
prime
federal
law
enforcement
organization
.
Operating
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
U.S.
Department
of
Justice
,
FBI
is
concurrently
a
member
of
the
U.S.
Intelligence
Community
and
reports
to
both
the
Attorney
General
and
the
Director
of
National
Intelligence
.
A
leading
U.S.
counterterrorism
,
counterintelligence
,
and
criminal
investigative
organization
,
FBI
has
jurisdiction
over
violations
of
more
than
200
categories
of
federal
crimes
.
J.
Edgar
Hoover
served
as
Director
from
1924
to
1972
,
a
combined
48
years
with
the
BOI
,
DOI
,
and
FBI
.
He
was
chiefly
responsible
for
creating
the
Scientific
Crime
Detection
Laboratory
,
or
the
FBI
Laboratory
,
which
officially
opened
in
1932
,
as
part
of
his
work
to
professionalize
investigations
by
the
government
.
Hoover
was
substantially
involved
in
most
major
cases
and
projects
that
the
FBI
handled
during
his
tenure
.
After
Hoover
's
death
,
Congress
passed
legislation
that
limited
the
tenure
of
future
FBI
Directors
to
ten
years
.
Despite
its
domestic
focus
,
the
FBI
also
maintains
a
significant
international
footprint
,
operating
60
Legal
Attache
(
LEGAT
)
offices
and
15
sub-offices
in
U.S.
embassies
and
consulates
across
the
globe
.
These
overseas
offices
exist
primarily
for
the
purpose
of
coordination
with
foreign
security
services
and
do
not
usually
conduct
unilateral
operations
in
the
host
countries
.
The
FBI
can
and
does
at
times
carry
out
secret
activities
overseas
,
just
as
the
CIA
has
a
limited
domestic
function
;
these
activities
generally
require
coordination
across
government
agencies
.
In
1939
,
the
Bureau
began
compiling
a
custodial
detention
list
with
the
names
of
those
who
would
be
taken
into
custody
in
the
event
of
war
with
Axis
nations
.
The
majority
of
the
names
on
the
list
belonged
to
Issei
community
leaders
,
as
the
FBI
investigation
built
on
an
existing
Naval
Intelligence
index
that
had
focused
on
Japanese
Americans
in
Hawaii
and
the
West
Coast
,
but
many
German
and
Italian
nationals
also
found
their
way
onto
the
secret
list
.
Robert
Shivers
,
head
of
the
Honolulu
office
,
obtained
permission
from
Hoover
to
start
detaining
those
on
the
list
on
December
7
,
1941
,
while
bombs
were
still
falling
over
Pearl
Harbor
.
Mass
arrests
and
searches
of
homes
(
in
most
cases
conducted
without
warrants
)
began
a
few
hours
after
the
attack
,
and
over
the
next
several
weeks
more
than
5,500
Issei
men
were
taken
into
FBI
custody
.
On
February
19
,
1942
,
President
Franklin
Roosevelt
issued
Executive
Order
9066
,
authorizing
the
removal
of
Japanese
Americans
from
the
West
Coast
.
FBI
Director
Hoover
opposed
the
subsequent
mass
removal
and
confinement
of
Japanese
Americans
authorized
under
Executive
Order
9066
,
but
Roosevelt
prevailed
.
The
vast
majority
went
along
with
the
subsequent
exclusion
orders
,
but
in
a
handful
of
cases
where
Japanese
Americans
refused
to
obey
the
new
military
regulations
,
FBI
agents
handled
their
arrests
.
The
Bureau
continued
surveillance
on
Japanese
Americans
throughout
the
war
,
conducting
background
checks
on
applicants
for
resettlement
outside
camp
,
and
entering
the
camps
(
usually
without
the
permission
of
War
Relocation
Authority
officials
)
and
grooming
informants
in
order
to
monitor
dissidents
and
"
troublemakers
.
"
After
the
war
,
the
FBI
was
assigned
to
protect
returning
Japanese
Americans
from
attacks
by
hostile
white
communities
.
In
response
to
organized
crime
,
on
August
25
,
1953
,
the
FBI
created
the
Top
Hoodlum
Program
.
The
national
office
directed
field
offices
to
gather
information
on
mobsters
in
their
territories
and
to
report
it
regularly
to
Washington
for
a
centralized
collection
of
intelligence
on
racketeers
.
After
the
Racketeer
Influenced
and
Corrupt
Organizations
Act
,
or
RICO
Act
,
took
effect
,
the
FBI
began
investigating
the
former
Prohibition
-
organized
groups
,
which
had
become
fronts
for
crime
in
major
cities
and
small
towns
.
All
of
the
FBI
work
was
done
undercover
and
from
within
these
organizations
,
using
the
provisions
provided
in
the
RICO
Act
.
Gradually
the
agency
dismantled
many
of
the
groups
.
Although
Hoover
initially
denied
the
existence
of
a
National
Crime
Syndicate
in
the
United
States
,
the
Bureau
later
conducted
operations
against
known
organized
crime
syndicates
and
families
,
including
those
headed
by
Sam
Giancana
and
John
Gotti
.
The
RICO
Act
is
still
used
today
for
all
organized
crime
and
any
individuals
who
might
fall
under
the
Act.
After
Congress
passed
the
Communications
Assistance
for
Law
Enforcement
Act
(
CALEA
,
1994
)
,
the
Health
Insurance
Portability
and
Accountability
Act
(
HIPAA
,
1996
)
,
and
the
Economic
Espionage
Act
(
EEA
,
1996
)
,
the
FBI
followed
suit
and
underwent
a
technological
upgrade
in
1998
,
just
as
it
did
with
its
CART
team
in
1991
.
Computer
Investigations
and
Infrastructure
Threat
Assessment
Center
(
CITAC
)
and
the
National
Infrastructure
Protection
Center
(
NIPC
)
were
created
to
deal
with
the
increase
in
Internet-related
problems
,
such
as
computer
viruses
,
worms
,
and
other
malicious
programs
that
threatened
US
operations
.
With
these
developments
,
the
FBI
increased
its
electronic
surveillance
in
public
safety
and
national
security
investigations
,
adapting
to
the
telecommunications
advancements
that
changed
the
nature
of
such
problems
.
For
over
40
years
,
the
FBI
crime
lab
in
Quantico
believed
lead
in
bullets
had
unique
chemical
signatures
.
It
analyzed
the
bullets
with
the
goal
of
matching
them
chemically
,
not
only
to
a
single
batch
of
ammunition
coming
out
of
a
factory
,
but
also
to
a
single
box
of
bullets
.
The
National
Academy
of
Sciences
conducted
an
18
-
month
independent
review
of
comparative
bullet
-
lead
analysis
.
In
2003
,
its
National
Research
Council
published
a
report
whose
conclusions
called
into
question
30
years
of
FBI
testimony
.
It
found
the
analytic
model
used
by
the
FBI
for
interpreting
results
was
deeply
flawed
,
and
the
conclusion
,
that
bullet
fragments
could
be
matched
to
a
box
of
ammunition
,
was
so
overstated
that
it
was
misleading
under
the
rules
of
evidence
.
One
year
later
,
the
FBI
decided
to
stop
doing
bullet
lead
analysis
.
The
FBI
's
chief
tool
against
organized
crime
is
the
Racketeer
Influenced
and
Corrupt
Organizations
(
RICO
)
Act
.
The
FBI
is
also
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
enforcing
compliance
of
the
United
States
Civil
Rights
Act
of
1964
and
investigating
violations
of
the
act
in
addition
to
prosecuting
such
violations
with
the
United
States
Department
of
Justice
(
DOJ
)
.
The
FBI
also
shares
concurrent
jurisdiction
with
the
Drug
Enforcement
Administration
(
DEA
)
in
the
enforcement
of
the
Controlled
Substances
Act
of
1970
.
The
FBI
often
works
in
conjunction
with
other
Federal
agencies
,
including
the
U.S.
Coast
Guard
(
USCG
)
and
U.S.
Customs
and
Border
Protection
(
CBP
)
in
seaport
and
airport
security
,
and
the
National
Transportation
Safety
Board
in
investigating
airplane
crashes
and
other
critical
incidents
.
Immigration
and
Customs
Enforcement
Homeland
Security
Investigations
(
ICE
-
HSI
)
has
nearly
the
same
amount
of
investigative
man
power
as
the
FBI
,
and
investigates
the
largest
range
of
crimes
.
In
the
wake
of
the
September
11
attacks
,
then
-Attorney
General
Ashcroft
assigned
the
FBI
as
the
designated
lead
organization
in
terrorism
investigations
after
the
creation
of
the
U.S.
Department
of
Homeland
Security
.
ICE
-HSI
and
the
FBI
are
both
integral
members
of
the
Joint
Terrorism
Task
Force
.
The
FBI
Academy
,
located
in
Quantico
,
Virginia
,
is
home
to
the
communications
and
computer
laboratory
the
FBI
utilizes
.
It
is
also
where
new
agents
are
sent
for
training
to
become
FBI
Special
Agents
.
Going
through
the
21
-
week
course
is
required
for
every
Special
Agent
.
First
opened
for
use
in
1972
,
the
facility
located
on
385
acres
(
1.6
km2
)
of
woodland
.
The
Academy
trains
state
and
local
law
enforcement
agencies
,
which
are
invited
to
the
law

The
FBI
frequently
investigated
Martin
Luther
King
,
Jr
.
In
the
mid-1960s
,
King
began
publicly
criticizing
the
Bureau
for
giving
insufficient
attention
to
the
use
of
terrorism
by
white
supremacists
.
Hoover
responded
by
publicly
calling
King
the
most
"
notorious
liar
"
in
the
United
States
.
In
his
1991
memoir
,
Washington
Post
journalist
Carl
Rowan
asserted
that
the
FBI
had
sent
at
least
one
anonymous
letter
to
King
encouraging
him
to
commit
suicide
.
Historian
Taylor
Branch
documents
an
anonymous
November
1964
"
suicide
package
"
sent
by
the
Bureau
that
combined
a
letter
to
the
civil
rights
leader
telling
him
"
You
are
done
.
There
is
only
one
way
out
for
you
...
"
with
audio
recordings
of
King
's
sexual
indiscretions
.
The
National
Incident
Based
Reporting
System
(
NIBRS
)
crime
statistics
system
aims
to
address
limitations
inherent
in
UCR
data
.
The
system
is
used
by
law
enforcement
agencies
in
the
United
States
for
collecting
and
reporting
data
on
crimes
.
Local
,
state
,
and
federal
agencies
generate
NIBRS
data
from
their
records
management
systems
.
Data
is
collected
on
every
incident
and
arrest
in
the
Group
A
offense
category
.
The
Group
A
offenses
are
46
specific
crimes
grouped
in
22
offense
categories
.
Specific
facts
about
these
offenses
are
gathered
and
reported
in
the
NIBRS
system
.
In
addition
to
the
Group
A
offenses
,
eleven
Group
B
offenses
are
reported
with
only
the
arrest
information
.
The
NIBRS
system
is
in
greater
detail
than
the
summary
-
based
UCR
system
.
As
of
2004
,
5,271
law
enforcement
agencies
submitted
NIBRS
data
.
That
amount
represents
20
%
of
the
United
States
population
and
16
%
of
the
crime
statistics
data
collected
by
the
FBI
.
The
FBI
also
spied
upon
and
collected
information
on
Puerto
Rican
independence
leader
Pedro
Albizu
Campos
and
his
Nationalist
political
party
in
the
1930s
.
Abizu
Campos
was
convicted
three
times
in
connection
with
deadly
attacks
on
US
government
officials
:
in
1937
(
Conspiracy
to
overthrow
the
government
of
the
United
States
)
,
in
1950
(
attempted
murder
)
,
and
in
1954
(
after
an
armed
assault
on
the
US
House
of
Representatives
while
in
session
;
although
not
present
,
Abizu
Campos
was
considered
the
mastermind
)
.
The
FBI
operation
was
covert
and
did
not
become
known
until
U.S.
Congressman
Luis
Gutierrez
had
it
made
public
via
the
Freedom
of
Information
Act
in
the
1980s
.
The
FBI
is
organized
into
functional
branches
and
the
Office
of
the
Director
,
which
contains
most
administrative
offices
.
An
executive
assistant
director
manages
each
branch
.
Each
branch
is
then
divided
into
offices
and
divisions
,
each
headed
by
an
assistant
director
.
The
various
divisions
are
further
divided
into
sub-branches
,
led
by
deputy
assistant
directors
.
Within
these
sub-branches
there
are
various
sections
headed
by
section
chiefs
.
Section
chiefs
are
ranked
analogous
to
special
agents
in
charge
.
The
FBI
is
headquartered
at
the
J.
Edgar
Hoover
Building
in
Washington
,
D.C.
,
with
56
field
offices
in
major
cities
across
the
United
States
.
The
FBI
also
maintains
over
400
resident
agencies
across
the
United
States
,
as
well
as
over
50
legal
attachés
at
United
States
embassies
and
consulates
.
Many
specialized
FBI
functions
are
located
at
facilities
in
Quantico
,
Virginia
,
as
well
as
a
"
data
campus
"
in
Clarksburg
,
West
Virginia
,
where
96
million
sets

collected
by
American
authorities
from

Carnivore
was
an
electronic
eavesdropping
software
system
implemented
by
the
FBI
during
the
Clinton
administration
;
it
was
designed
to
monitor
email
and
electronic
communications
.
After
prolonged
negative
coverage
in
the
press
,
the
FBI
changed
the
name
of
its
system
from
"
Carnivore
"
to
"
DCS1000
.
"
DCS
is
reported
to
stand
for
"
Digital
Collection
System
"
;
the
system
has
the
same
functions
as
before
.
The
Associated
Press
reported
in
mid-January
2005
that
the
FBI
essentially
abandoned
the
use
of
Carnivore
in
2001
,
in
favor
of
commercially
available
software
,
such
as
NarusInsight
.
FBI
Directors
are
appointed
by
the
President
of
the
United
States
.
They
must
be
confirmed
by
the
United
States
Senate
and
serve
a
term
of
office
of
five
years
,
with
a
maximum
of
ten
years
,
if
reappointed
,
unless
they
resign
or
are
fired
by
the
President
before
their
term
ends
.
J.
Edgar
Hoover
,
appointed
by
Calvin
Coolidge
in
1924
,
was
by
far
the
longest-
serving
director
,
serving
until
his
death
in
1972
.
In
1968
,
Congress
passed
legislation
as
part
of
the
Omnibus
Crime
Control
and
Safe
Streets
Act
Pub.L.
90–351
,
June
19
,

Stat.
197
that
specified
a
10
-
year
limit
,
a
maximum
of
two
5
-
year
terms
,
for
future
FBI
Directors
,
as
well
as
requiring
Senate
confirmation
of
appointees
.
As
the
incumbent
,
this
legislation
did
not
apply
to
Hoover
,
only
to
his
successors
.
The
current
FBI
Director
is
James
B.
Comey
,
who
was
appointed
in
2013
by
Barack
Obama
.
The
FBI
has
been
frequently
depicted
in
popular
media
since
the
1930s
.
The
bureau
has
participated
to
varying
degrees
,
which
has
ranged
from
direct
involvement
in
the
creative
process
of
film
or
TV
series
development
,
to
providing
consultation
on
operations
and
closed
cases
.
A
few
of
the
notable
portrayals
of
the
FBI
on
television
are
the
1993
-
2002
series
The
X-Files
,
which
concerned
investigations
into
paranormal
phenomena
by
five
fictional
Special
Agents
and
the
fictional
Counter
Terrorist
Unit
(
CTU
)
agency
in
the
TV
drama
24
,
which
is
patterned
after
the
FBI
Counterterrorism
Division
.
The
1991
movie
Point
Break
is
based
on
the
true
story
of
an
undercover
FBI
agent
who
infiltrated
a
gang
of
bank
robbers
.
The
1997
movie
Donnie
Brasco
is
based
on
the
true
story
of
undercover
FBI
agent
Joseph
D.
Pistone
infiltrating
the
Mafia
.
During
the
period
from
1993
to
2011
,
FBI
agents
fired
their
weapons
on
289
occasions
;
FBI
internal
reviews
found
the
shots
justified
in
all
but
5
cases
,
in
none
of
the
5
cases
were
people
wounded
.
Samuel
Walker
,
a
professor
of
criminal
justice
at
the
University
of
Nebraska
Omaha
said
the
number
of
shots
found
to
be
unjustified
was
"
suspiciously
low
.
"
In
the
same
time
period
,
the
FBI
wounded
150
people
,
70
of
whom
died
;
the
FBI
found
all
150
shootings
to
be
justified
.
Likewise
,
during
the
period
from
2011
to
the
present
,
all
shootings
by
FBI
agents
have
been
found
to
be
justified
by
internal
investigation
.
In
a
2002
case
in
Maryland
,
an
innocent
man
was
shot
,
and
later
paid
$
1.3
million
by
the
FBI
after
agents
mistook
him
for
a
bank
robber
;
the
internal
investigation
found
that
the
shooting
was
justified
,
based
on
the
man
's
actions
.
In
2005
,
fugitive
Puerto
Rican
Nationalist
leader
Filiberto
Ojeda
Ríos
died
in
a
gun
battle
with
FBI
agents
in
2005
in
what
some
charged
was
an
assassination

Puerto

Governor
Aníbal
Acevedo
Vilá
criticized
the
FBI
assault
as
"
improper
"
and
"
highly
irregular
"
and
demanded
to
know
why
his
government
was
not
informed
of
it
.
The
FBI
refused
to
release
information
beyond
the
official
press
release
,
citing
security
and
agent
privacy
issues
.
The
Puerto
Rico
Justice
Department
filed
suit
in
federal
court
against
the
FBI
and
the
US
Attorney
General
,
demanding
information
crucial
to
the
Commonwealth
's
own
investigation
of
the
incident
.
The
case
was
dismissed

;
Spanish
:
[

)
,
or
València
(
Valencian
:

)
,
is
the
capital
of
the
autonomous
community
of
Valencia
and
the
third
largest
city
in
Spain
after
Madrid
and
Barcelona
,
with
around
800,000
inhabitants
in
the
administrative
centre
.
Its
urban
area
extends
beyond
the
administrative
city
limits
with
a
population
of
around
1.5
million
people
.
Valencia
is
Spain
's
third
largest
metropolitan
area
,
with
a
population
ranging
from
1.7
to
2.5
million
.
The
city
has
global
city
status
.
The
Port
of
Valencia
is
the
5th
busiest
container
port
in
Europe
and
the
busiest
container
port
on
the
Mediterranean
Sea
.
Valencia
enjoyed
strong
economic
growth
over
the
last
decade
,
much
of
it
spurred
by
tourism
and
the
construction
industry
,
[

with
concurrent
development
and
expansion
of
telecommunications
and
transport
.
The
city
's
economy
is
service
-
oriented
,
as
nearly
84
%
of
the
working
population
is
employed
in
service
sector
occupations
[

.
However
,
the
city
still
maintains
an
important
industrial
base
,
with
5.5
%
of
the
population
employed
in
this
sector
.
Agricultural
activities
are
still
carried
on
in
the
municipality
,
even
though
of
relatively
minor
importance
with
only
1.9
%
of
the
working
population
and
3973
hectares
planted
mostly
in
orchards
and
citrus
groves
.
Public
transport
is
provided
by
the
Ferrocarrils
de
la
Generalitat
Valenciana
(
FGV
)
,
which
operates
the
Metrovalencia
and
other
rail
and
bus
services
.
The
Estació
del
Nord
(
North
Station
)
is
the
main
railway
terminus
in
Valencia
.
A
new
temporary
station
,
Estación
de
València-Joaquín
Sorolla
,
has
been
built
on
land
adjacent
to
this
terminus
to
accommodate
high
speed
AVE
trains
to
and
from
Madrid
,
Barcelona
,
Seville
and
Alicante
.
Valencia
Airport
is
situated
9
km
(
5.6
mi
)
west
of
Valencia
city
centre
.
Alicante
Airport
is
situated
about
170
km
(
110
mi
)
south
of
Valencia
.
Starting
in
the
mid-1990s
,
Valencia
,
formerly
an
industrial
centre
,
saw
rapid
development
that
expanded
its
cultural
and
touristic
possibilities
,
and
transformed
it
into
a
newly
vibrant
city
.
Many
local
landmarks
were
restored
,
including
the
ancient
Towers
of
the
medieval
city
(
Serrano
Towers
and
Quart
Towers
)
,
and
the
San
Miguel
de
los
Reyes
monastery
,
which
now
holds
a
conservation
library
.
Whole
sections
of
the
old
city
,
for
example
the
Carmen
Quarter
,
have
been
extensively
renovated
.
The
Paseo
Marítimo
,
a
4
km
(
2
mi
)
long
palm
tree-lined
promenade
was
constructed
along
the
beaches
of
the
north
side
of
the
port
(
Playa
Las
Arenas
,
Playa
Cabañal
and
Playa
de
la
Malvarrosa
)
.
The
English
held
the
city
for
16
months
and
defeated
several
attempts
to
expel
them
.
English
soldiers
advanced
as
far
as
Requena
on
the
road
to
Madrid
.
After
the
victory
of
the
Bourbons
at
the
Battle
of
Almansa
on
25
April
1707
,
the
English
army
evacuated
Valencia
and
Philip
V
ordered
the
repeal
of
the
privileges
of
Valencia
as
punishment
for
the
kingdom
's
support
of
Charles
of
Austria
.
By
the
Nueva
Planta
decrees
(
Decretos
de
Nueva
Planta
)
the
ancient
Charters
of
Valencia
were
abolished
and
the
city
was
governed
by
the
Castilian
Charter
.
The
Bourbon
forces
burned
important
cities
like
Xativa
,
where
pictures
of
the
Spanish
Bourbons
in
public
places
are
hung
upside
down
as
a
protest
to
this
day
.
The
capital
of
the
Kingdom
of
Valencia
was
moved
to
Orihuela
,
an
outrage
to
the
citizens
of
Valencia
.
Philip
ordered
the
Cortes
to
meet
with
the
Viceroy
of
Valencia
,
Cardinal
Luis
de
Belluga
,
who
opposed
the
change
of
capital
because
of
the
proximity
of
Orihuela
,
a
religious
,
cultural
and
now
political
centre
,
to
Murcia
(
capital
of
another
viceroyalty
and
his
diocese
)
.
Because
of
his
hatred
of
the
city
of
Orihuela
,
which
had
bombarded
and
looted
Valencia
during
the
War
of
Succession
,
the
cardinal
resigned
the
viceroyalty
in
protest
against
the
actions
of
Philip
,
who
finally
relented
and
returned
the
capital
to
Valencia
.
The
city
remained
in
the
hands
of
Christian
troops
until
1102
,
when
the
Almoravids
retook
the
city
and
restored
the
Muslim
religion
.
Although
the
self-styled
'
Emperor
of
All
Spain
'
,
Alfonso
VI
of
León
and
Castile
,
drove
them
from
the
city
,
he
was
not
strong
enough
to
hold
it
.
The
Christians
set
it
afire
before
abandoning
it
,
and
the
Almoravid
Masdali
took
possession
on
5
May
1109
.
The
event
was
commemorated
in
a
poem
by
Ibn
Khafaja
in
which
he
thanked
Yusuf
ibn
Tashfin
for
the
city
's
liberation
.
The
declining
power
of
the
Almoravids
coincided
with
the
rise
of
a
new
dynasty
in
North
Africa
,
the
Almohads
,
who
seized
control
of
the
peninsula
from
the
year
1145
,
although
their
entry
into
Valencia
was
deterred
by
Ibn
Mardanis
,
King
of
Valencia
and
Murcia
until
1171
,
at
which
time
the
city
finally
fell
to
the
North
Africans
.
The
two
Muslim
dynasties
would
rule
Valencia
for
more
than
a
century
.
The
15th
century
was
a
time
of
Islamic
economic
expansion
,
known
as
the
Valencian
Golden
Age
,
in
which
culture
and
the
arts
flourished
.
Concurrent
population
growth
made
Valencia
the
most
populous
city
in
the
Crown
of
Aragon
.
Local
industry
,
led
by
textile
production
,
reached
a
great
development
,
and
a
financial
institution
,
the
Canvi
de
Taula
,
was
created
to
support
municipal
banking
operations
;
Valencian
bankers
lent
funds
to
Queen
Isabella
I
of
Castile
for
Columbus
's
voyage
in
1492
.
At
the
end
of
the
century
the
Silk
Exchange
(
Llotja
de
la
Seda
)
building
was
erected
as
the
city
became
a
commercial
emporium
that
attracted
merchants
from
all
over
Europe
.
The
vicereine
Germaine
of
Foix
brutally
repressed
the
uprising
and
its
leaders
,
and
this
accelerated
the
authoritarian
centralisation
of
the
government
of
Charles
I.
Queen
Germaine
favoured
harsh
treatment
of
the
agermanats
.
She
is
thought
to
have
signed
the
death
warrants
of
100
former
rebels
personally
,
and
sources
indicate
that
as
many
as
800
executions
may
have
occurred
.
The
agermanats
are
comparable
to
the
comuneros
of
neighbouring
Castile
,
who
fought
a
similar
revolt
against
Charles
from
1520
–
1522
.
In
the
early
20th
century
Valencia
was
an
industrialised
city
.
The
silk
industry
had
disappeared
,
but
there
was
a
large
production
of
hides
and
skins
,
wood
,
metals
and
foodstuffs
,
this
last
with
substantial
exports
,
particularly
of
wine
and
citrus
.
Small
businesses
predominated
,
but
with
the
rapid
mechanisation
of
industry
larger
companies
were
being
formed
.
The
best
expression
of
this
dynamic
was
in
the
regional
exhibitions
,
including
that
of
1909
held
next
to
the
pedestrian
avenue
L'Albereda
(
Paseo
de
la
Alameda
)
,
which
depicted
the
progress
of
agriculture
and
industry
.
Among
the
most
architecturally
successful
buildings
of
the
era
were
those
designed
in
the
Art
Nouveau
style
,
such
as
the
North
Station
(
Gare
du
Nord
)
and
the
Central
and
Columbus
markets
.
Its
average
annual
temperature
is
18.4
°C
(
65.1
°F
)
.
22.8
°C
(
73.0
°F
)
during
the
day
and
13.8
°C
(
56.8
°F
)
at
night
.
In
the
coldest
month
–
January
,
the
maximum
temperature
typically
during
the
day
ranges
from
13
to
21
°C
(
55
to
70
°F
)
,
the
minimum
temperature
typically
at
night
ranges
from
4
to
12
°C
(
39
to
54
°
F
)
.
In
the
warmest
month
–
August
,
the
maximum
temperature
during
the
day
typically
ranges
from
28–
34
°C
(
82–93
°F
)
,
about
23
°C
(
73
°F
)
at
night
.
Generally
,
temperatures
similar
to
those
experienced
in
the
northern
part
of
Europe
in
summer
last
about
8
months
,
from
April
to
November
.
March
is
transitional
,
the
temperature
often
exceeds
20
°C
(
68
°F
)
,
with
an
average
temperature
of
19.0
°C
(
66
°F
)
during
the
day
and
10.0
°C
(
50
°F
)
at
night
.
December
,
January
and
February
are
the
coldest
months
,
with
average
temperatures
around
17
°C
(
63
°F
)
during
the
day
and
7
°C
(
45
°F
)
at
night
.
Valencia
has
one
of
the
mildest
winters
in
Europe
,
owing
to
its
southern
location
on
the
Mediterranean
Sea
and
the
Foehn
phenomenon
.
The
January
average
is
comparable
to
temperatures
expected
for
May
and
September
in
the
major
cities
of
northern
Europe
.
The
Valencian
economy
recovered
during
the
18th
century
with
the
rising
manufacture
of
woven
silk
and
ceramic
tiles
.
The
Palau
de
Justícia
is
an
example
of
the
affluence
manifested
in
the
most
prosperous
times
of
Bourbon
rule
(
1758
–
1802
)
during
the
rule
of
Charles
III
.
The
18th
century
was
the
age
of
the
Enlightenment
in
Europe
,
and
its
humanistic
ideals
influenced
such
men
as
Gregory
Maians
and
Perez
Bayer
in
Valencia
,
who
maintained
correspondence
with
the
leading
French
and
German
thinkers
of
the
time
.
In
this
atmosphere
of
the
exaltation
of
ideas
the
Economic
Society
of
Friends
of
the
Country
(
Societat
Econòmica
d'Amics
del
País
)
was
founded
in
1776
;
it
introduced
numerous
improvements
in
agriculture
and
industry
and
promoted
various
cultural
,
civic
,
and
economic
institutions
in
Valencia
.
The
dictatorship
of
Franco
forbade
political
parties
and
began
a
harsh
ideological
and
cultural
repression
countenanced
and
sometimes
even
led
by
the
Church
.
The
financial
markets
were
destabilised
,
causing
a
severe
economic
crisis
that
led
to
rationing
.
A
black
market
in
rationed
goods
existed
for
over
a
decade
.
The
Francoist
administrations
of
Valencia
silenced
publicity
of
the
catastrophic
consequences
of
the
floods
of
1949
with
the
attendant
dozens
of
deaths
,
but
could
not
do
the
same
after
the
even
more
tragic
flood
of
1957
when
the
river
Turia
overflowed
its
banks
again
,
killing
many
Valencians
(
officially
,
eighty
-
one
died
;
the
actual
figure
is
not
known
)
.
To
prevent
further
disasters
,
the
river
was
eventually
diverted
to
a
new
course
.
The
old
river
bed
was
abandoned
for
years
,
and
successive
Francoist
mayors
proposed
making
it
a
motorway
,
but
that
option
was
finally
rejected
with
the
advent
of
democracy
and
fervent
neighbourhood
protests
.
The
river
was
divided
in
two
at
the
western
city
limits
(
Plan
Sur
de
Valencia
)
,
and
diverted
southwards
along
a
new
course
that
skirts
the
city
,
before
meeting
the
Mediterranean
.
The
old
course
of
the
river
continues
,
dry
,
through
the
city
centre
,
almost
to
the
sea
.
The
old
riverbed
is
now
a
verdant
sunken
park
called
the
'
Garden
of
the
Turia
'
(
Jardí
del
Túria
or
Jardín
del
Turia
)
that
allows
cyclists
and
pedestrians
to
traverse
much
of
the
city
without
the
use
of
roads
;
overhead
bridges
carry
motor
traffic
across
the
park
.
Valencia
's
port
is
the
biggest
on
the
Mediterranean
western
coast
,
the
first
of
Spain
in
container
traffic
as
of
2008
and
the
second
of
Spain
in
total
traffic
,
handling
20
%
of
Spain
's
exports
.
The
main
exports
are
foodstuffs
and
beverages
.
Other
exports
include
oranges
,
furniture
,
ceramic
tiles
,
fans
,
textiles
and
iron
products
.
Valencia
's
manufacturing
sector
focuses
on
metallurgy
,
chemicals
,
textiles
,
shipbuilding
and
brewing
.
Small
and
medium-sized
industries
are
an
important
part
of
the
local
economy
,
and
before
the
current
crisis
unemployment
was
lower
than
the
Spanish
average
.
A
fervent
follower
of
the
absolutist
cause
,
Elío
had
played
an
important
role
in
the
repression
of
the
supporters
of
the
Constitution
of
1812
.
For
this
,
he
was
arrested
in
1820
and
executed
in
1822
by
garroting
.
Conflict
between
absolutists
and
liberals
continued
,
and
in
the
period
of
conservative
rule
called
the
Ominous
Decade
(
1823
–
1833
)
,
which
followed
the
Trienio
Liberal
,
there
was
ruthless
repression
by
government
forces
and
the
Catholic
Inquisition
.
The
last
victim
of
the
Inquisition
was
Gaietà
Ripoli
,
a
teacher
accused
of
being
a
deist
and
a
Mason
who
was
hanged
in
Valencia
in
1824
.
On
9
July
2006
,
during
Mass
at
Valencia
's
Cathedral
,
Our
Lady
of
the
Forsaken
Basilica
,
Pope
Benedict
XVI
used
,
at
the
World
Day
of
Families
,
the
Santo
Caliz
,
a
1st-century
Middle
-
Eastern
artifact
that
some
Catholics
believe
is
the
Holy
Grail
.
It
was
supposedly
brought
to
that
church
by
Emperor
Valerian
in
the
3rd
century
,
after
having
been
brought
by
St.
Peter
to
Rome
from
Jerusalem
.
The
Santo
Caliz
(
Holy
Chalice
)
is
a
simple
,
small
stone
cup
.
Its
base
was
added
in
Medieval
Times
and
consists
of
fine
gold
,
alabaster
and
gem
stones
.
During
the
Cantonal
Revolution
of
1873
,
a
cantonalist
uprising
that
took
place
during
the
First
Spanish
Republic
,
the
city
was
consolidated
with
most
of
the
nearby
cities
in
the
Federal
Canton
of
Valencia
(
proclaimed
on
19
July
and
dissolved
on
7
August
)
.
It
did
not
have
the
revolutionary
fervor
of
the
movement
in
cities
like
Alcoy
,
as
it
was
initiated
by
the
bourgeoisie
,
but
the
Madrid
government
sent
General
Martinez
-
Campos
to
stifle
the
rebellion
by
force
of
arms
and
subjected
Valencia
to
an
intense
bombardment
.
The
city
surrendered
on
7
August
;
Alfonso
XII
was
proclaimed
king
on
29
December
1874
,
and
arrived
in
Valencia
on
11
January
1875
on
his
way
to
Madrid
,
marking
the
end
of
the
first
republic
.
Despite
the
Bourbon
restoration
,
the
roughly
even
balance
between
conservatives
and
liberals
in
the
government
was
sustained
in
Valencia
until
the
granting
of
universal
male
suffrage
in
1890
,
after
which
the
Republicans
,
led
by
Vicente
Blasco
Ibáñez
,
gained
considerably
more
of
the
popular
vote
.
World-
renowned
(
and
city
-
born
)
architect
Santiago
Calatrava
produced
the
futuristic
City
of
Arts
and
Sciences
(
Ciutat
de
les
Arts
i
les
Ciències
)
,
which
contains
an
opera
house
/
performing
arts
centre
,
a
science
museum
,
an
IMAX
cinema
/
planetarium
,
an
oceanographic
park
and
other
structures
such
as
a
long
covered
walkway
and
restaurants
.
Calatrava
is
also
responsible
for
the
bridge
named
after
him
in
the
centre
of
the
city
.
The
Music
Palace
(
Palau
De
La
Música
)
is
another
noteworthy
example
of
modern
architecture
in
Valencia
.
Valencia
is
a
bilingual
city
:
Valencian
and
Spanish
are
the
two
official
languages
.
Spanish
is
official
in
all
of
Spain
,
whereas
Valencian
is
official
in
the
Valencian
Country
,
as
well
as
in
Catalonia
and
the
Balearic
Islands
,
where
it
receives
the
name
of
Catalan
.
Despite
the
differentiated
denomination
,
the
distinct
dialectal
traits
and
political
tension
between
Catalonia
and
the
Valencian
Country
,
Catalan
and
Valencian
are
mutually
intelligible
and
are
considered
two
varieties
of
the
same
language
.
Valencian
has
been
historically
repressed
in
favour
of
Spanish
.
The
effects
have
been
more
noticeable
in
the
city
proper
,
whereas
the
language
has
remained
active
in
the
rural
and
metropolitan
areas
.
After
the
Castille-Aragon
unification
,
a
Spanish
-speaking
elite
established
itself
in
the
city
.
In
more
recent
history
,
the
establishment
of
Franco
's
military
and
administrative
apparatus
in
Valencia
further
excluded
Valencian
from
public
life
.
Valencian
recovered
its
official
status
,
prestige
and
use
in
education
after
the
transition
to
democracy
in
1978
.
However
,
due
to
industrialisation
in
recent
decades
,
Valencia
has
attracted
immigration
from
other
regions
in
Spain
,
and
hence
there
is
also
a
demographic
factor
for
its
declining
social
use
.
Due
to
a
combination
of
these
reasons
,
Valencia
has
become
the
bastion
of
anti-Catalan
blaverism
,
which
celebrates
Valencian
as
merely
folkloric
,
but
rejects
the
existing
standard
which
was
adapted
from
Catalan
orthography
.
Spanish
is
currently
the
predominant
language
in
the
city
proper
but
,
thanks
to
the
education
system
,
most
Valencians
have
basic
knowledge
of
both
Spanish
and
Valencian
,
and
either
can
be
used
in
the
city
.
Valencia
is
therefore
the
second
biggest
Catalan
-
speaking
city
after
Barcelona
.
Institutional
buildings
and
streets
are
named
in
Valencian
.
The
city
is
also
home
to
many
pro-Valencian
political
and
civil
organisations
.
Furthermore
,
education
entirely
in
Valencian
is
offered
in
more
than
70
state-owned
schools
in
the
city
,
as
well
as
by
the
University
of
Valencia
across
all
disciplines
.
Valencia
has
experienced
a
surge
in
its
cultural
development
during
the
last
thirty
years
,
exemplified
by
exhibitions
and
performances
at
such
iconic
institutions
as
the
Palau
de
la
Música
,
the
Palacio
de
Congresos
,
the
Metro
,
the
City
of
Arts
and
Sciences
(
Ciutat
de
les
Arts
i
les
Ciències
)
,
the
Valencian
Museum
of
Enlightenment
and
Modernity
(
Museo
Valenciano
de
la
Ilustracion
y
la
Modernidad
)
,
and
the
Institute
of
Modern
Art
(
Instituto
Valenciano
de
Arte
Moderno
)
.
The
various
productions
of
Santiago
Calatrava
,
a
renowned
structural
engineer
,
architect
,
and
sculptor
and
of
the
architect
Félix
Candela
have
contributed
to
Valencia
's
international
reputation
.
These
public
works
and
the
ongoing
rehabilitation
of
the
Old
City
(
Ciutat
Vella
)
have
helped
improve
the
city
's
livability
and
tourism
is
continually
increasing
.
Among
the
parish
churches
are
Saints
John
(
Baptist
and
Evangelist
)
,
rebuilt
in
1368
,
whose
dome
,
decorated
by
Palonino
,
contains
some
of
the
best
frescoes
in
Spain
;
El
Templo
(
the
Temple
)
,
the
ancient
church
of
the
Knights
Templar
,
which
passed
into
the
hands
of
the
Order
of
Montesa
and
was
rebuilt
in
the
reigns
of
Ferdinand
VI
and
Charles
III
;
the
former
convent
of
the
Dominicans
,
at
one
time
the
headquarters
of
the
Capital
General
,
the
cloister
of
which
has
a
beautiful
Gothic
wing
and
the
chapter
room
,
large
columns
imitating
palm
trees
;
the
Colegio
del
Corpus
Christi
,
which
is
devoted
to
the
Blessed
Sacrament
,
and
in
which
perpetual
adoration
is
carried
on
;
the
Jesuit
college
,
which
was
destroyed
in
1868
by
the
revolutionary
Committee
of
the
Popular
Front
,
but
later
rebuilt
;
and
the
Colegio
de
San
Juan
(
also
of
the
Society
)
,
the
former
college
of
the
nobles
,
now
a
provincial
institute
for
secondary
instruction
.
A
few
centuries
later
,
coinciding
with
the
first
waves
of
the
invading
Germanic
peoples
(
Suevi
,
Vandals
and
Alans
,
and
later
the
Visigoths
)
and
the
power
vacuum
left
by
the
demise
of
the
Roman
imperial
administration
,
the
church
assumed
the
reins
of
power
in
the
city
and
replaced
the
old
Roman
temples
with
religious
buildings
.
With
the
Byzantine
invasion
of
the
southwestern
Iberian
peninsula
in
554
the
city
acquired
strategic
importance
.
After
the
expulsion
of
the
Byzantines
in
625
,
Visigothic
military
contingents
were
posted
there
and
the
ancient
Roman
amphitheatre
was
fortified
.
Little
is
known
of
its
history
for
nearly
a
hundred
years
;
although
this
period
is
only
scarcely
documented
by
archeology
,
excavations
suggest
that
there
was
little
development
of
the
city
.
During
Visigothic
times
Valencia
was
an
episcopal
See
of
the
Catholic
Church
,
albeit
a
suffragan
diocese
subordinate
to
the
archdiocese
of
Toledo
,
comprising
the
ancient
Roman
province
of
Carthaginensis
in
Hispania
.
In
the
15th
century
the
dome
was
added
and
the
naves
extended
back
of
the
choir
,
uniting
the
building
to
the
tower
and
forming
a
main
entrance
.
Archbishop
Luis
Alfonso
de
los
Cameros
began
the
building
of
the
main
chapel
in
1674
;
the
walls
were
decorated
with
marbles
and
bronzes
in
the
Baroque
style
of
that
period
.
At
the
beginning
of
the
18th
century
the
German
Conrad
Rudolphus
built
the
façade
of
the
main
entrance
.
The
other
two
doors
lead
into
the
transept
;
one
,
that
of
the
Apostles
in
pure
pointed
Gothic
,
dates
from
the
14th
century
,
the
other
is
that
of
the
Paláu
.
The
additions
made
to
the
back
of
the
cathedral
detract
from
its
height
.
The
18th
-
century
restoration
rounded
the
pointed
arches
,
covered
the
Gothic
columns
with
Corinthian
pillars
,
and
redecorated
the
walls
.
The
dome
has
no
lantern
,
its
plain
ceiling
being
pierced
by
two
large
side
windows
.
There
are
four
chapels
on
either
side
,
besides
that
at
the
end
and
those
that
open
into
the
choir
,
the
transept
,
and
the
sanctuary
.
It
contains
many
paintings
by
eminent
artists
.
A
silver
reredos
,
which
was
behind
the
altar
,
was
carried
away
in
the
war
of
1808
,
and
converted
into
coin
to
meet
the
expenses
of
the
campaign
.
There
are
two
paintings
by
Francisco
Goya
in
the
San
Francesco
chapel
.
Behind
the
Chapel
of
the
Blessed
Sacrament
is
a
small
Renaissance
chapel
built
by
Calixtus
III
.
Beside
the
cathedral
is
the
chapel
dedicated
to
the
Our
Lady
of
the
Forsaken
(
Virgen
de
los
desamparados
or
Mare
de
Déu
dels
Desamparats
)
.
In
1238
,
King
James
I
of
Aragon
,
with
an
army
composed
of
Aragonese
,
Catalans
,
Navarrese
and
crusaders
from
the
Order
of
Calatrava
,
laid
siege
to
Valencia
and
on
28
September
obtained
a
surrender
.
Fifty
thousand
Moors
were
forced
to
leave
.
Poets
such
as
Ibn
al-
Abbar
and
Ibn
Amira
mourned
this
exile
from
their
beloved
Valencia
.
After
the
Christian
victory
and
the
expulsion
of
the
Muslim
population
the
city
was
divided
between
those
who
had
participated
in
the
conquest
,
according
to
the
testimony
in
the
Llibre
del
Repartiment
(
Book
of
Distribution
)
.
James
I
granted
the
city
new
charters
of
law
,
the
Furs
of
Valencia
,
which
later
were
extended
to
the
whole
kingdom
of
Valencia
.
Thenceforth
the
city
entered
a
new
historical
stage
in
which
a
new
society
and
a
new
language
developed
,
forming
the
basis
of
the
character
of
the
Valencian
people
as
they
are
known
today
.
In
its
long
history
,
Valencia
has
acquired
many
local
traditions
and
festivals
,
among
them
the
Falles
,
which
were
declared
Celebrations
of
International
Touristic
Interest
(
Fiestas
de
Interés
Turístico
Internacional
)
on
25
January
1965
,
and
the
Water
Tribunal
of
Valencia
(
Tribunal
de
las
Aguas
de
Valencia
)
,
which
was
declared
an
intangible
cultural
heritage
of
humanity
(
Patrimonio
Cultural
Inmaterial
de
la
Humanidad
)
in
2009
.
In
addition
to
these
Valencia
has
hosted
world
-
class
events
that
helped
shape
the
city
's
reputation
and
put
it
in
the
international
spotlight
,
e.g.
,
the
Regional
Exhibition
of
1909
,
the
32nd
and
the
33rd
America
's
Cup
competitions
,
the
European
Grand
Prix
of
Formula
One
auto
racing
,
the
Valencia
Open
500
tennis
tournament
,
and
the
Global
Champions
Tour
of
equestrian
sports
.
The
city
had
surrendered
without
a
fight
to
the
invading
Moors
(
Berbers
and
Arabs
)
by
714
AD
,
and
the
cathedral
of
Saint
Vincent
was
turned
into
a
mosque
.
Abd
al
-
Rahman
I
,
the
first
emir
of
Cordoba
,
ordered
the
city
destroyed
in
755
during
his
wars
against
other
nobility
,
but
several
years
later
his
son
,
Abdullah
,
had
a
form
of
autonomous
rule
over
the
province
of
Valencia
.
Among
his
administrative
acts
he
ordered
the
building
of
a
luxurious
palace
,
the
Russafa
,
on
the
outskirts
of
the
city
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
same
name
.
So
far
no
remains
have
been
found
.
Also
at
this
time
Valencia
received
the
name
Medina
al-
Turab
(
City
of
Sand
)
.
When
Islamic
culture
settled
in
,
Valencia
,
then
called
Balansiyya
,
prospered
from
the
10th
century
,
due
to
a
booming
trade
in
paper
,
silk
,
leather
,
ceramics
,
glass
and
silver-work
.
The
architectural
legacy
of
this
period
is
abundant
in
Valencia
and
can
still
be
appreciated
today
in
the
remnants
of
the
old
walls
,
the
Baños
del
Almirante
bath
house
,
Portal
de
Valldigna
street
and
even
the
Cathedral
and
the
tower
,
El
Micalet
(
El
Miguelete
)
,
which
was
the
minaret
of
the
old
mosque
.
This
boom
was
reflected
in
the
growth
of
artistic
and
cultural
pursuits
.
Some
of
the
most
emblematic
buildings
of
the
city
were
built
during
this
period
,
including
the
Serranos
Towers
(
1392
)
,
the
Lonja
(
1482
)
,
the
Miguelete
and
the
Chapel
of
the
Kings
of
the
Convent
of
Santo
Domingo
.
In
painting
and
sculpture
,
Flemish
and
Italian
trends
had
an
influence
on
artists
such
as
Lluís
Dalmau
,
Peris
Gonçal
and
Damià
Forment
.
Literature
flourished
with
the
patronage
of
the
court
of
Alfonso
the
Magnanimous
,
supporting
authors
like
Ausiàs
March
,
Roiç
de
Corella
,
and
Isabel
de
Villena
.
By
1460
Joanot
Martorell
wrote
Tirant
lo
Blanch
,
an
innovative
novel
of
chivalry
that
influenced
many
later
writers
,
from
Cervantes
to
Shakespeare
.
Ausiàs
March
was
one
of
the
first
poets
to
use
the
everyday
language
Valencian
,
instead
of
the
troubadour
language
,
Occitan
.
Also
around
this
time
,
between
1499
and
1502
,
the
University
of
Valencia
was
founded
under
the
parsimonious
name
of
Estudio
General
(
"
studium
generale
"
,
place
of
general
studies
)
.
The
decline
of
the
city
reached
its
nadir
with
the
War
of
Spanish
Succession
(
1702
–
1709
)
that
marked
the
end
of
the
political
and
legal
independence
of
the
Kingdom
of
Valencia
.
During
the
War
of
the
Spanish
Succession
,
Valencia
sided
with
Charles
of
Austria
.
On
24
January
1706
,
Charles
Mordaunt
,
3rd
Earl
of
Peterborough
,
1st
Earl
of
Monmouth
,
led
a
handful
of
English
cavalrymen
into
the
city
after
riding
south
from
Barcelona
,
capturing
the
nearby
fortress
at
Sagunt
,
and
bluffing
the
Spanish
Bourbon
army
into
withdrawal
.
The
mutineers
seized
the
Citadel
,
a
Supreme
Junta
government
took
over
,
and
on
26–28
June
,
Napoleon
's
Marshal
Moncey
attacked
the
city
with
a
column
of
9,000
French
imperial
troops
in
the
First
Battle
of
Valencia
.
He
failed
to
take
the
city
in
two
assaults
and
retreated
to
Madrid
.
Marshal
Suchet
began
a
long
siege
of
the
city
in
October
1811
,
and
after
intense
bombardment
forced
it
to
surrender
on
8
January
1812
.
After
the
capitulation
,
the
French
instituted
reforms
in
Valencia
,
which
became
the
capital
of
Spain
when
the
Bonapartist
pretender
to
the
throne
,
José
I
(
Joseph
Bonaparte
,
Napoleon
's
elder
brother
)
,
moved
the
Court
there
in
the
summer
of
1812
.
The
disaster
of
the
Battle
of
Vitoria
on
21
June
1813
obliged
Suchet
to
quit
Valencia
,
and
the
French
troops
withdrew
in
July
.
The
crisis
deepened
during
the
17th
century
with
the
expulsion
in
1609
of
the
Jews
and
the
Moriscos
,
descendants
of
the
Muslim
population
that
converted
to
Christianity
under
threat
of
exile
from
Ferdinand
and
Isabella
in
1502
.
From
1609
through
1614
,
the
Spanish
government
systematically
forced
Moriscos
to
leave
the
kingdom
for
Muslim
North
Africa
.
They
were
concentrated
in
the
former
Kingdom
of
Aragon
,
where
they
constituted
a
fifth
of
the
population
,
and
the
Valencia
area
specifically
,
where
they
were
roughly
a
third
of
the
total
population
.
The
expulsion
caused
the
financial
ruin
of
some
of
the
nobility
and
the
bankruptcy
of
the
Taula
de
Canvi
in
1613
.
The
Crown
endeavoured
to
compensate
the
nobles
,
who
had
lost
much
of
their
agricultural
labour
force
;
this
harmed
the
economy
of
the
city
for
generations
to
come
.
Later
,
during
the
so-called
Catalan
Revolt
(
1640
–
1652
)
,
Valencia
contributed
to
the
cause
of
Philip
IV
with
militias
and
money
,
resulting
in
a
period
of
further
economic
hardship
exacerbated
by
the
arrival
of
troops
from
other
parts
of
Spain
.
During
the
second
half
of
the
19th
century
the
bourgeoisie
encouraged
the
development
of
the
city
and
its
environs
;
land-owners
were
enriched
by
the
introduction
of
the
orange
crop
and
the
expansion
of
vineyards
and
other
crops
,
.
This
economic
boom
corresponded
with
a
revival
of
local
traditions
and
of
the
Valencian
language
,
which
had
been
ruthlessly
suppressed
from
the
time
of
Philip
V.
Around
1870
,
the
Valencian
Renaissance
,
a
movement
committed
to
the
revival
of
the
Valencian
language
and
traditions
,
began
to
gain
ascendancy
.
In
its
early
stages
the
movement
inclined
to
the
romanticism
of
the
poet
Teodor
Llorente
,
and
resisted
the
more
assertive
remonstrances
of
Constantine
Llombart
,
founder
of
the
still
extant
cultural
society
,
Lo
Rat
Penat
,
which
is
dedicated
to
the
promotion
and
dissemination
of
the
Valencian
language
and
culture
.
During
the
regency
of
Maria
Cristina
,
Espartero
ruled
Spain
for
two
years
as
its
18th
Prime
Minister
from
16
September
1840
to
21
May
1841
.
Under
his
progressive
government
the
old
regime
was
tenuously
reconciled
to
his
liberal
policies
.
During
this
period
of
upheaval
in
the
provinces
he
declared
that
all
the
estates
of
the
Church
,
its
congregations
,
and
its
religious
orders
were
national
property
—
though
in
Valencia
,
most
of
this
property
was
subsequently
acquired
by
the
local
bourgeoisie
.
City
life
in
Valencia
carried
on
in
a
revolutionary
climate
,
with
frequent
clashes
between
liberals
and
republicans
,
and
the
constant
threat
of
reprisals
by
the
Carlist
troops
of
General
Cabrera
.
The
Valencia
Metro
derailment
occurred
on
3
July
2006
at
1
pm.
CEST
(
1100
UTC
)
between
Jesús
and
Plaça
d'Espanya
stations
on
Line
1
of
the
Metrovalencia
mass
transit
system
.
43
people
were
killed
and
more
than
ten
were
seriously
injured
.
It
was
not
immediately
clear
what
caused
the
crash
.
Both
the
Valencian
government
spokesman
Vicente
Rambla
and
Mayor
Rita
Barberá
called
the
accident
a
"
fortuitous
"
event
.
However
,
the
trade
union
CC.OO
.
accused
the
authorities
of
"
rushing
"
to
say
anything
but
admit
that
Line
1
is
in
a
state
of
"
constant
deterioration
"
with
a
"
failure
to
carry
out
maintenance
"
.
During
the
20th
century
Valencia
remained
the
third
most
populous
city
of
Spain
as
its
population
tripled
,
rising
from
213,550
inhabitants
in
1900
to
739,014
in
2000
.
Valencia
was
also
third
in
industrial
and
economic
development
;
notable
milestones
include
urban
expansion
of
the
city
in
the
latter
1800s
,
the
creation
of
the
Banco
de
Valencia
in
1900
,
construction
of
the
Central
and
Columbus
markets
,
and
the
construction
of
the
Gare
du
Nord
railway
station
,
completed
in
1921
.
The
new
century
was
marked
in
Valencia
with
a
major
event
,
the
Valencian
regional
exhibition
of
1909
(
La
Exposición
Regional
Valenciana
de
1909
)
,
which
emulated
the
national
and
universal
expositions
held
in
other
cities
.
This
production
was
promoted
by
the
Ateneo
Mercantil
de
Valencia
(
Mercantile
Athenaeum
of
Valencia
)
,
especially
by
its
chairman
,
Tomás
Trénor
y
Palavicino
,
and
had
the
support
of
the
Government
and
the
Crown
;
it
was
officially
inaugurated
by
King
Alfonso
XIII
himself
.
The
inevitable
march
to
civil
war
and
the
combat
in
Madrid
resulted
in
the
removal
of
the
capital
of
the
Republic
to
Valencia
.
On
6
November
1936
the
city
became
the
capital
of
Republican
Spain
under
the
control
of
the
prime
minister
Manuel
Azana
;
the
government
moved
to
the
Palau
de
Benicarló
,
its
ministries
occupying
various
other
buildings
.
The
city
was
heavily
bombarded
by
air
and
sea
,
necessitating
the
construction
of
over
two
hundred
bomb
shelters
to
protect
the
population
.
On
13
January
1937
the
city
was
first
shelled
by
a
vessel
of
the
Fascist
Italian
Navy
,
which
was
blockading
the
port
by
the
order
of
Benito
Mussolini
.
The
bombardment
intensified
and
inflicted
massive
destruction
on
several
occasions
;
by
the
end
of
the
war
the
city
had
survived
442
bombardments
,
leaving
2,831
dead
and
847
wounded
,
although
it
is
estimated
that
the
death
toll
was
higher
,
as
the
data
given
are
those
recognised
by
Francisco
Franco
's
government
.
The
Republican
government
passed
to
Juan
Negrín
on
17
May
1937
and
on
31
October
of
that
year
moved
to
Barcelona
.
On
30
March
1939
Valencia
surrendered
and
the
Nationalist
troops
entered
the
city
.
The
postwar
years
were
a
time
of
hardship
for
Valencians
.
During
Franco
's
regime
speaking
or
teaching
Valencian
was
prohibited
;
in
a
significant
reversal
it
is
now
compulsory
for
every
schoolchild
in
Valencia
.
In
March
2012
,
the
newspaper
El
Mundo
published
a
story
according
to
which
FGV
had
instructed
employees
who
were
to
testify
at
the
crash
commission
investigation
,
providing
a
set
of
possible
questions
and
guidelines
to
prepare
the
answers
.
In
April
2013
,
the
television
program
Salvados
questioned
the
official
version
of
the
incident
as
there
were
indications
that
the
Valencian
Government
had
tried
to
downplay
the
accident
,
which
coincided
with
the
visit
of
the
pope
to
Valencia
,
or
even
to
hide
evidence
,
as
the
book
of
train
breakdowns
was
never
found
.
The
day
after
the
broadcast
of
this
report
,
which
received
extensive
media
coverage
,
several
voices
called
for
the
reopening
of
the
investigation
.
The
investigation
was
effectively
reopened
and
the
accident
is
currently
under
re-examination
.
In
1409
,
a
hospital
was
founded
and
placed
under
the
patronage
of
Santa
María
de
los
Inocentes
;
to
this
was
attached
a
confraternity
devoted
to
recovering
the
bodies
of
the
unfriended
dead
in
the
city
and
within
a
radius
of
three
miles
(
4.8
km
)
around
it
.
At
the
end
of
the
15th
century
this
confraternity
separated
from
the
hospital
,
and
continued
its
work
under
the
name
of
"
Cofradia
para
el
ámparo
de
los
desamparados
"
.
King
Philip
IV
of
Spain
and
the
Duke
of
Arcos
suggested
the
building
of
the
new
chapel
,
and
in
1647
the
Viceroy
,
Conde
de
Oropesa
,
who
had
been
preserved
from
the
bubonic
plague
,
insisted
on
carrying
out
their
project
.
The
Blessed
Virgin
was
proclaimed
patroness
of
the
city
under
the
title
of
Virgen
de
los
desamparados
(
Virgin
of
the
Forsaken
)
,
and
Archbishop
Pedro
de
Urbina
,
on
31
June
1652
,
laid
the
cornerstone
of
the
new
chapel
of
this
name
.
The
archiepiscopal
palace
,
a
grain
market
in
the
time
of
the
Moors
,
is
simple
in
design
,
with
an
inside
cloister
and
a
handsome
chapel
.
In
1357
,
the
arch
that
connects
it
with
the
cathedral
was
built
.
In
the
council
chamber
are
preserved
the
portraits
of
all
the
prelates
of
Valencia
.
Valencia
is
also
internationally
famous
for
its
football
club
,
Valencia
C.F.
,
which
won
the
Spanish
league
in
2002
and
2004
(
the
year
it
also
won
the
UEFA
Cup
)
,
for
a
total
of
six
times
,
and
was
a
UEFA
Champions
League
runner
-
up
in
2000
and
2001
.
The
team
's
stadium
is
the
Mestalla
;
its
city
rival
Levante
UD
also
plays
in
the
highest
division
after
gaining
promotion
in
2010
,
their
stadium
is
Estadi
Ciutat
de
València
.
From
the
year
2011
there
has
been
a
third
team
in
the
city
,
Huracán
Valencia
,
who
play
their
games
in
Municipal
de
Manises
,
in
the
Segunda

B.
Valencia
was
founded
as
a
Roman
colony
in
138
BC
.
The
city
is
situated
on
the
banks
of
the
Turia
,
on
the
east
coast
of
the
Iberian
Peninsula
,
fronting
the
Gulf
of
Valencia
on
the
Mediterranean
Sea
.
Its
historic
centre
is
one
of
the
largest
in
Spain
,
with
approximately
169
hectares
;
this
heritage
of
ancient
monuments
,
views
and
cultural
attractions
makes
Valencia
one
of
the
country
's
most
popular
tourist
destinations
.
Major
monuments
include
Valencia
Cathedral
,
the
Torres
de
Serrans
,
the
Torres
de
Quart
,
the
Llotja
de
la
Seda
(
declared
a

in
1996
)
,
and
the
Ciutat

cultural
and
architectural
complex
designed
by
Santiago
Calatrava
and
Félix
Candela
.
The
Museu
de
Belles
Arts
de
València
houses
a
large
collection
of
paintings
from
the
14th
to
the
18th
centuries
,
including
works
by
Velázquez
,
El
Greco
,
and
Goya
,
as
well
as
an
important
series
of
engravings
by
Piranesi
.
The
Institut
Valencià
d'Art
Modern
(
Valencian
Institute
of
Modern
Art
)
houses
both
permanent
collections
and
temporary
exhibitions
of
contemporary
art
and

.
Valencia
stands
on
the
banks
of
the
Turia
River
,
located
on
the
eastern
coast
of
the
Iberian
Peninsula
and
the
western
part
of
the
Mediterranean
Sea
,
fronting
the
Gulf
of
Valencia
.
At
its
founding
by
the
Romans
,
it
stood
on
a
river
island
in
the
Turia
,
6.4
km
(
4
mi
)
from
the
sea
.
The
Albufera
,
a
freshwater
lagoon
and
estuary
about
11
km
(
7
mi
)
south
of
the
city
,
is
one
of
the
largest
lakes
in
Spain
.
The
City
Council
bought
the
lake
from
the
Crown
of
Spain
for
1,072,980
pesetas
in
1911
,
and
today
it
forms
the
main
portion
of
the
Parc
Natural
de
l'Albufera
(
Albufera
Nature
Reserve
)
,
with
a
surface
area
of
21,120
hectares
(
52,200
acres
)
.
In
1986
,
because
of
its
cultural
,
historical
,
and
ecological
value
,
the
Generalitat
Valenciana
declared
it
a
natural
park
.
The
third
largest
city
in
Spain
and
the
24th
most
populous
municipality
in
the
European
Union
,
Valencia
has
a
population
of
809,267
within
its
administrative
limits
on
a
land
area
of
134.6
km2
(
52
sq
mi
)
.
The
urban
area
of
Valencia
extending
beyond
the
administrative
city
limits
has
a
population
of
between
1,561,000
and
1,564,145
.
1,705,742
or
2,300,000
or
2,516,818
people
live
in
the
Valencia
metropolitan
area
.
Between
2007
and
2008
there
was
a
14
%
increase
in
the
foreign
born
population
with
the
largest
numeric
increases
by
country
being
from
Bolivia
,
Romania
and
Italy
.
About
two
thousand
Roman
colonists
were
settled
there
in
138
BC
during
the
rule
of
consul
Decimus
Junius
Brutus
Galaico
.
The
Roman
historian
Florus
says
that
Brutus
transferred
the
soldiers
who
had
fought
under
him
to
that
province
.
This
was
a
typical
Roman
city
in
its
conception
,
as
it
was
located
in
a
strategic
location
near
the
sea
on
a
river
island
crossed
by
the
Via
Augusta
,
the
imperial
road
that
connected
the
province
to
Rome
,
the
capital
of
the
empire
.
The
centre
of
the
city
was
located
in
the
present
-
day
neighbourhood
of
the
Plaza
de
la
Virgen
.
Here
was
the
forum
and
the
crossing
of
the
Cardo
Maximus
and
the
Decumanus
Maximus
,
which
remain
the
two
main
axes
of
the
city
.
The
Cardo
corresponds
to
the
existing
Calle
de
Salvador
,
Almoina
,
and
the
Decumanus
corresponds
to
Calle
de
los
Caballeros
.
Balansiyya
had
a
rebirth
of
sorts
with
the
beginning
of
the
Taifa
of
Valencia
kingdom
in
the
11th
century
.
The
town
grew
,
and
during
the
reign
of
Abd
al
-
Aziz
a
new
city
wall
was
built
,
remains
of
which
are
preserved
throughout
the
Old
City
(
Ciutat
Vella
)
today
.
The
Castilian
nobleman
Rodrigo
Diaz
de
Vivar
,
known
as
El
Cid
,
who
was
intent
on
possessing
his
own
principality
on
the
Mediterranean
,
entered
the
province
in
command
of
a
combined
Christian
and
Moorish
army
and
besieged
the
city
beginning
in
1092
.
By
the
time
the
siege
ended
in
May
1094
,
he
had
carved
out
his
own
fiefdom
—
which
he
ruled
from
15
June
1094
to
July
1099
.
This
victory
was
immortalised
in
the
Lay
of
the
Cid
.
During
his
rule
,
he
converted
nine
mosques
into
churches
and
installed
the
French
monk
Jérôme
as
bishop
of
the
See
of
Valencia
.
El
Cid
was
killed
in
July
1099
while
defending
the
city
from
an
Almoravid
siege
,
whereupon
his
wife
Ximena
Díaz
ruled
in
his
place
for
two
years
.
The
city
went
through
serious
troubles
in
the
mid-fourteenth
century
.
On
the
one
hand
were
the
decimation
of
the
population
by
the
Black
Death
of
1348
and
subsequent
years
of
epidemics
—
and
on
the
other
,
the
series
of
wars
and
riots
that
followed
.
Among
these
were
the
War
of
the
Union
,
a
citizen
revolt
against
the
excesses
of
the
monarchy
,
led
by
Valencia
as
the
capital
of
the
kingdom
—
and
the
war
with
Castile
,
which
forced
the
hurried
raising
of
a
new
wall
to
resist
Castilian
attacks
in
1363
and
1364
.
In
these
years
the
coexistence
of
the
three
communities
that
occupied
the
city
—
Christian
,
Jewish
and
Muslim
—
was
quite
contentious
.
The
Jews
who
occupied
the
area
around
the
waterfront
had
progressed
economically
and
socially
,
and
their
quarter
gradually
expanded
its
boundaries
at
the
expense
of
neighbouring
parishes
.
Meanwhile
,
Muslims
who
remained
in
the
city
after
the
conquest
were
entrenched
in
a
Moorish
neighbourhood
next
to
the
present
-
day
market
Mosen
Sorel
.
In
1391
an
uncontrolled
mob
attacked
the
Jewish
quarter
,
causing
its
virtual
disappearance
and
leading
to
the
forced
conversion
of
its
surviving
members
to
Christianity
.
The
Muslim
quarter
was
attacked
during
a
similar
tumult
among
the
populace
in
1456
,
but
the
consequences
were
minor
.
Faced
with
this
loss
of
business
,
Valencia
suffered
a
severe
economic
crisis
.
This
manifested
early
in
1519
–
1523
when
the
artisan
guilds
known
as
the
Germanies
revolted
against
the
government
of
the
Habsburg
king
Charles
I
in
Valencia
,
now
part
of
the
Crown
of
Aragon
,
with
most
of
the
fighting
done
in
1521
.
The
revolt
was
an
anti-monarchist
,
anti-feudal
autonomist
movement
inspired
by
the
Italian
republics
,
and
a
social
revolt
against
the
nobility
who
had
fled
the
city
before
an
epidemic
of
plague
in
1519
.
It
also
bore
a
strong
anti-Islamic
aspect
,
as
rebels
rioted
against
Aragon
's
population
of
mudéjars
and
imposed
forced
conversions
to
Christianity
.
With
the
abolition
of
the
charters
of
Valencia
and
most
of
its
institutions
,
and
the
conformation
of
the
kingdom
and
its
capital
to
the
laws
and
customs
of
Castile
,
top
civil
officials
were
no
longer
elected
,
but
instead
were
appointed
directly
from
Madrid
,
the
king
's
court
city
,
the
offices
often
filled
by
foreign
aristocrats
.
Valencia
had
to
become
accustomed
to
being
an
occupied
city
,
living
with
the
presence
of
troops
quartered
in
the
Citadel
near
the
convent
of
Santo
Domingo
and
in
other
buildings
such
as
the
Lonja
,
which
served
as
a
barracks
until
1762
.
Ferdinand
refused
and
went
to
Valencia
instead
of
Madrid
.
Here
,
on
17
April
,
General
Elio
invited
the
King
to
reclaim
his
absolute
rights
and
put
his
troops
at
the
King
's
disposition
.
The
king
abolished
the
Constitution
of
1812
.
He
followed
this
act
by
dissolving
the
two
chambers
of
the
Spanish
Parliament
on
10
May
.
Thus
began
six
years
(
1814
–
1820
)
of
absolutist
rule
,
but
the
constitution
was
reinstated
during
the
Trienio
Liberal
,
a
period
of
three
years
of
liberal
government
in
Spain
from
1820
–
1823
.
The
public
water
supply
network
was
completed
in
1850
,
and
in
1858
the
architects
Sebastián
Monleón
Estellés
,
Antonino
Sancho
,
and
Timoteo
Calvo
drafted
a
general
expansion
project
for
the
city
that
included
demolishing
its
ancient
walls
(
a
second
version
was
printed
in
1868
)
.
Neither
proposed
project
received
final
approval
,
but
they
did
serve
as
a
guide
,
though
not
closely
followed
,
for
future
growth
.
By
1860
the
municipality
had
140,416
inhabitants
,
and
beginning
in
1866
the
ancient
city
walls
were
almost
entirely
demolished
to
facilitate
urban
expansion
.
Electricity
was
introduced
to
Valencia
in
1882
.
The
economy
began
to
recover
in
the
early
1960s
,
and
the
city
experienced
explosive
population
growth
through
immigration
spurred
by
the
jobs
created
with
the
implementation
of
major
urban
projects
and
infrastructure
improvements
.
With
the
advent
of
democracy
in
Spain
,
the
ancient
kingdom
of
Valencia
was
established
as
a
new
autonomous
entity
,
the
Valencian
Community
,
the
Statute
of
Autonomy
of
1982
designating
Valencia
as
its
capital
.
On
the
night
of
23
February
1981
,
shortly
after
Antonio
Tejero
had
stormed
Congress
,
the
Captain
General
of
the
Third
Military
Region
,
Jaime
Milans
del
Bosch
,
rose
up
in
Valencia
,
put
tanks
on
the
streets
,
declared
a
state
of
emergency
and
tried
to
convince
other
senior
military
figures
to
support
the
coup
.
After
the
televised
message
of
King
Juan
Carlos
I
,
those
in
the
military
who
had
not
yet
aligned
themselves
decided
to
remain
loyal
to
the
government
,
and
the
coup
failed
.
Despite
this
lack
of
support
,
Milans
del
Bosch
only
surrendered
at
5
a.m.
on
the
next
day
,
24
February
.
The
largest
plaza
in
Valencia
is
the
Plaza
del
Ayuntamiento
;
it
is
home
to
the
City
Hall
(
Ayuntamiento
)
on
its
western
side
and
the
central
post
office
(
Edificio
de
Correos
)
on
its
eastern
side
,
a
cinema
that
shows
classic
movies
,
and
many
restaurants
and
bars
.
The
plaza
is
triangular
in
shape
,
with
a
large
cement
lot
at
the
southern
end
,
normally
surrounded
by
flower
vendors
.
It
serves
as
ground
zero
during
the
Les
Falles
when
the
fireworks
of
the
Mascletà
can
be
heard
every
afternoon
.
There
is
a
large
fountain
at
the
northern
end
.
The
Valencia
Cathedral
was
called
Iglesia
Mayor
in
the
early
days
of
the
Reconquista
,
then
Iglesia
de
la
Seo
(
Seo
is
from
the
Latin
sedes
,
i.e.
,
(
archiepiscopal
)
See
)
,
and
by
virtue
of
the
papal
concession
of
16
October
1866
,
it
was
called
the
Basilica
Metropolitana
.
It
is
situated
in
the
centre
of
the
ancient
Roman
city
where
some
believe
the
temple
of
Diana
stood
.
In
Gothic
times
,
it
seems
to
have
been
dedicated
to
the
Holy
Saviour
;
the
Cid
dedicated
it
to
the
Blessed
Virgin
;
King
James
I
of
Aragon
did
likewise
,
leaving
in
the
main
chapel
the
image
of
the
Blessed
Virgin
,
which
he
carried
with
him
and
is
reputed
to
be
the
one
now
preserved
in
the
sacristy
.
The
Moorish
mosque
,
which
had
been
converted
into
a
Christian
Church
by
the
conqueror
,
was
deemed
unworthy
of
the
title
of
the
cathedral
of
Valencia
,
and
in
1262
Bishop
Andrés
de
Albalat
laid
the
cornerstone
of
the
new
Gothic
building
,
with
three
naves
;
these
reach
only
to
the
choir
of
the
present
building
.
Bishop
Vidal
de
Blanes
built
the
chapter
hall
,
and
James
I
added
the
tower
,
called
El
Miguelete
because
it
was
blessed
on
St.
Michael
's
day
in
1418
.
The
tower
is
about
58
m
high
and
topped
with
a
belfry
(
1660
–
1736
)
.
Once
a
year
between
2008
–
2012
the
European
Formula
One
Grand
Prix
took
place
in
the
Valencia
Street
Circuit
.
Valencia
is
among
with
Barcelona
,
Porto
and
Monte
Carlo
the
only
European
cities
ever
to
host
Formula
One
World
Championship
Grands
Prix
on
public
roads
in
the
middle
of
cities
.
The
final
race
in
2012
European
Grand
Prix
saw
an
extremely
popular
winner
,
since
home
driver
Fernando
Alonso
won
for
Ferrari
in
spite
of
starting
halfway
down
the
field
.
The
Valencian
Community
motorcycle
Grand
Prix
(
Gran
Premi
de
la
Comunitat
Valenciana
de
motociclisme
)
is
part
of
the
Grand
Prix
motorcycle
racing
season
at
the
Circuit
Ricardo
Tormo
(
also
known
as
Circuit
de
Valencia
)
.
Periodically
the
Spanish
round
of
the
Deutsche

Championship
(
DTM
)
is
held
in
Valencia
.
In
psychology
,
memory
is
the
process
in
which
information
is
encoded
,
stored
,
and
retrieved
.
Encoding
allows
information
from
the
outside
world
to
be
sensed
in
the
form
of
chemical
and
physical
stimuli
.
In
the
first
stage
the
information
must
be
changed
so
that
it
may
be
put
into
the
encoding
process
.
Storage
is
the
second
memory
stage
or
process
.
This
entails
that
information
is
maintained
over
short
periods
of
time
.
Finally
the
third
process
is
the
retrieval
of
information
that
has
been
stored
.
Such
information
must
be
located
and
returned
to
the
consciousness
.
Some
retrieval
attempts
may
be
effortless
due
to
the
type
of
information
,
and
other
attempts
to
remember
stored
information
may
be
more
demanding
for
various
reasons
.
Short
-
term
memory
is
believed
to
rely
mostly
on
an
acoustic
code
for
storing
information
,
and
to
a
lesser
extent
a
visual
code
.
Conrad
(
1964
)
found
that
test
subjects
had
more
difficulty
recalling
collections
of
letters
that
were
acoustically
similar
(
e.g.
E
,
P
,
D
)
.
Confusion
with
recalling
acoustically
similar
letters
rather
than
visually
similar
letters
implies
that
the
letters
were
encoded
acoustically
.
Conrad
's
(
1964
)
study
,
however
,
deals
with
the
encoding
of
written
text
;
thus
,
while
memory
of
written
language
may
rely
on
acoustic
components
,
generalisations
to
all
forms
of
memory
cannot
be
made
.
Short
-
term
memory
is
also
known
as
working
memory
.
Short
-
term
memory
allows
recall
for
a
period
of
several
seconds
to
a
minute
without
rehearsal
.
Its
capacity
is
also
very
limited
:
George
A.
Miller
(
1956
)
,
when
working
at
Bell
Laboratories
,
conducted
experiments
showing
that
the
store
of
short
-
term
memory
was
7±2
items
(
the
title
of
his
famous
paper
,
"
The
magical
number
7±2
"
)
.
Modern
estimates
of
the
capacity
of
short
-
term
memory
are
lower
,
typically
of
the
order
of
4–5
items
;
however
,
memory
capacity
can
be
increased
through
a
process
called
chunking
.
For
example
,
in
recalling
a
ten-digit
telephone
number
,
a
person
could
chunk
the
digits
into
three
groups
:
first
,
the
area
code
(
such
as
123
)
,
then
a
three
-
digit
chunk
(
456
)
and
lastly
a
four-digit
chunk
(
7890
)
.
This
method
of
remembering
telephone
numbers
is
far
more
effective
than
attempting
to
remember
a
string
of
10
digits
;
this
is
because
we
are
able
to
chunk
the
information
into
meaningful
groups
of
numbers
.
This
may
be
reflected
in
some
countries
in
the
tendency
to
display
telephone
numbers
as
several
chunks
of
two
to
four
numbers
.
The
storage
in
sensory
memory
and
short-term
memory
generally
has
a
strictly
limited
capacity
and
duration
,
which
means
that
information
is
not
retained
indefinitely
.
By
contrast
,
long-
term
memory
can
store
much
larger
quantities
of
information
for
potentially
unlimited
duration
(
sometimes
a
whole
life
span
)
.
Its
capacity
is
immeasurable
.
For
example
,
given
a
random
seven-
digit
number
we
may
remember
it
for
only
a
few
seconds
before
forgetting
,
suggesting
it
was
stored
in
our
short
-term
memory
.
On
the
other
hand
,
we
can
remember
telephone
numbers
for
many
years
through
repetition
;
this
information
is
said
to
be
stored
in
long-term
memory
.
The
model
also
shows
all
the
memory
stores
as
being
a
single
unit
whereas
research
into
this
shows
differently
.
For
example
,
short
-
term
memory
can
be
broken
up
into
different
units
such
as
visual
information
and
acoustic
information
.
In
a
study
by
Zlonoga
and
Gerber
(
1986
)
,
patient
'
KF
'
demonstrated
certain
deviations
from
the
Atkinson
–Shiffrin
model
.
Patient
KF
was
brain
damaged
,
displaying
difficulties
regarding
short
-term
memory
.
Recognition
of
sounds
such
as
spoken
numbers
,
letters
,
words
and
easily
identifiable
noises
(
such
as
doorbells
and
cats
meowing
)
were
all
impacted
.
Interestingly
,
visual
short
-
term
memory
was
unaffected
,
suggesting
a
dichotomy
between
visual
and
audial
memory
.
Short
-
term
memory
is
supported
by
transient
patterns
of
neuronal
communication
,
dependent
on
regions
of
the
frontal
lobe
(
especially
dorsolateral
prefrontal
cortex
)
and
the
parietal
lobe
.
Long-term
memory
,
on
the
other
hand
,
is
maintained
by
more
stable
and
permanent
changes
in
neural
connections
widely
spread
throughout
the
brain
.
The
hippocampus
is
essential
(
for
learning
new
information
)
to
the
consolidation
of
information
from
short
-term
to
long-
term
memory
,
although
it
does
not
seem
to
store
information
itself
.
Without
the
hippocampus
,
new
memories
are
unable
to
be
stored
into
long-term
memory
,
as
learned
from
patient
Henry
Molaison
after
removal
of
both
his
hippocampi
,
and
there
will
be
a
very
short
attention
span
.
Furthermore
,
it
may
be
involved
in
changing
neural
connections
for
a
period
of
three
months
or
more
after
the
initial
learning
.
Sensory
memory
holds
sensory
information
less
than
one
second
after
an
item
is
perceived
.
The
ability
to
look
at
an
item
and
remember
what
it
looked
like
with
just
a
split
second
of
observation
,
or
memorization
,
is
the
example
of
sensory
memory
.
It
is
out
of
cognitive
control
and
is
an
automatic
response
.
With
very
short
presentations
,
participants
often
report
that
they
seem
to
"
see
"
more
than
they
can
actually
report
.
The
first
experiments
exploring
this
form
of
sensory
memory
were
conducted
by
George
Sperling
(
1963
)
using
the
"
partial
report
paradigm
"
.
Subjects
were
presented
with
a
grid
of
12
letters
,
arranged
into
three
rows
of
four
.
After
a
brief
presentation
,
subjects
were
then
played
either
a
high
,
medium
or
low
tone
,
cuing
them
which
of
the
rows
to
report
.
Based
on
these
partial
report
experiments
,
Sperling
was
able
to
show
that
the
capacity
of
sensory
memory
was
approximately
12
items
,
but
that
it
degraded
very
quickly
(
within
a
few
hundred
milliseconds
)
.
Because
this
form
of
memory
degrades
so
quickly
,
participants
would
see
the
display
but
be
unable
to
report
all
of
the
items
(
12
in
the
"
whole
report
"
procedure
)
before
they
decayed
.
This
type
of
memory
cannot
be
prolonged
via
rehearsal
.
While
short
-
term
memory
encodes
information
acoustically
,
long-
term
memory
encodes
it
semantically
:
Baddeley
(
1966
)
discovered
that
,
after
20
minutes
,
test
subjects
had
the
most
difficulty
recalling
a
collection
of
words
that
had
similar
meanings
(
e.g.
big
,
large
,
great
,
huge
)
long-term
.
Another
part
of
long-
term
memory
is
episodic
memory
,
"
which
attempts
to
capture
information
such
as
'
what
'
,
'
when
'
and
'
where
'
"
.
With
episodic
memory
,
individuals
are
able
to
recall
specific
events
such
as
birthday
parties
and
weddings
.
Infants
do
not
have
the
language
ability
to
report
on
their
memories
and
so
verbal
reports
cannot
be
used
to
assess
very
young
children
’s
memory
.
Throughout
the
years
,
however
,
researchers
have
adapted
and
developed
a
number
of
measures
for
assessing
both
infants
’
recognition
memory
and
their
recall
memory
.
Habituation
and
operant
conditioning
techniques
have
been
used
to
assess
infants
’
recognition
memory
and
the
deferred
and
elicited
imitation
techniques
have
been
used
to
assess
infants
’
recall
memory
.
Another
major
way
to
distinguish
different
memory
functions
is
whether
the
content
to
be
remembered
is
in
the
past
,
retrospective
memory
,
or
in
the
future
,
prospective
memory
.
Thus
,
retrospective
memory
as
a
category
includes
semantic
,
episodic
and
autobiographical
memory
.
In
contrast
,
prospective
memory
is
memory
for
future
intentions
,
or
remembering
to
remember
(
Winograd
,
1988
)
.
Prospective
memory
can
be
further
broken
down
into
event
-
and
time
-
based
prospective
remembering
.
Time
-
based
prospective
memories
are
triggered
by
a
time
-
cue
,
such
as
going
to
the
doctor
(
action
)
at
4
pm
(
cue
)
.
Event-
based
prospective
memories
are
intentions
triggered
by
cues
,
such
as
remembering
to
post
a
letter
(
action
)
after
seeing
a
mailbox
(
cue
)
.
Cues
do
not
need
to
be
related
to
the
action
(
as
the
mailbox
/
letter
example
)
,
and
lists
,
sticky
-notes
,
knotted
handkerchiefs
,
or
string
around
the
finger
all
exemplify
cues
that
people
use
as
strategies
to
enhance
prospective
memory
.
Hebb
distinguished
between
short-term
and
long-term
memory
.
He
postulated
that
any
memory
that
stayed
in
short
-
term
storage
for
a
long
enough
time
would
be
consolidated
into
a
long-term
memory
.
Later
research
showed
this
to
be
false
.
Research
has
shown
that
direct
injections
of
cortisol
or
epinephrine
help
the
storage
of
recent
experiences
.
This
is
also
true
for
stimulation
of
the
amygdala
.
This
proves
that
excitement
enhances
memory
by
the
stimulation
of
hormones
that
affect
the
amygdala
.
Excessive
or
prolonged
stress
(
with
prolonged
cortisol
)
may
hurt
memory
storage
.
Patients
with
amygdalar
damage
are
no
more
likely
to
remember
emotionally
charged
words
than
nonemotionally
charged
ones
.
The
hippocampus
is
important
for
explicit
memory
.
The
hippocampus
is
also
important
for
memory
consolidation
.
The
hippocampus
receives
input
from
different
parts
of
the
cortex
and
sends
its
output
out
to
different
parts
of
the
brain
also
.
The
input
comes
from
secondary
and
tertiary
sensory
areas
that
have
processed
the
information
a
lot
already
.
Hippocampal
damage
may
also
cause
memory
loss
and
problems
with
memory
storage
.
This
memory
loss
includes
,
retrograde
amnesia
which
is
the
loss
of
memory
for
events
that
occurred
shortly
before
the
time
of
brain
damage
.
One
question
that
is
crucial
in
cognitive
neuroscience
is
how
information
and
mental
experiences
are
coded
and
represented
in
the
brain
.
Scientists
have
gained
much
knowledge
about
the
neuronal
codes
from
the
studies
of
plasticity
,
but
most
of
such
research
has
been
focused
on
simple
learning
in
simple
neuronal
circuits
;
it
is
considerably
less
clear
about
the
neuronal
changes
involved
in
more
complex
examples
of
memory
,
particularly
declarative
memory
that
requires
the
storage
of
facts
and
events
(
Byrne
2007
)
.
Convergence
-divergence
zones
might
be
the
neural
networks
where
memories
are
stored
and
retrieved
.
Cognitive
neuroscientists
consider
memory
as
the
retention
,
reactivation
,
and
reconstruction
of
the
experience
-
independent
internal
representation
.
The
term
of
internal
representation
implies
that
such
definition
of
memory
contains
two
components
:
the
expression
of
memory
at
the
behavioral
or
conscious
level
,
and
the
underpinning
physical
neural
changes
(
Dudai
2007
)
.
The
latter
component
is
also
called
engram
or
memory
traces
(
Semon
1904
)
.
Some
neuroscientists
and
psychologists
mistakenly
equate
the
concept
of
engram
and
memory
,
broadly
conceiving
all
persisting
after-effects
of
experiences
as
memory
;
others
argue
against
this
notion
that
memory
does
not
exist
until
it
is
revealed
in
behavior
or
thought
(
Moscovitch
2007
)
.
In
contrast
,
procedural
memory
(
or
implicit
memory
)
is
not
based
on
the
conscious
recall
of
information
,
but
on
implicit
learning
.
It
can
best
be
summarized
as
remember
how
to
do
something
.
Procedural
memory
is
primarily
employed
in
learning
motor
skills
and
should
be
considered
a
subset
of
implicit
memory
.
It
is
revealed
when
one
does
better
in
a
given
task
due
only
to
repetition
-
no
new
explicit
memories
have
been
formed
,
but
one
is
unconsciously
accessing
aspects
of
those
previous
experiences
.
Procedural
memory
involved
in
motor
learning
depends
on
the
cerebellum
and
basal
ganglia
.
The
working
memory
model
explains
many
practical
observations
,
such
as
why
it
is
easier
to
do
two
different
tasks
(
one
verbal
and
one
visual
)
than
two
similar
tasks
(
e.g.
,
two
visual
)
,
and
the
aforementioned
word-length
effect
.
However
,
the
concept
of
a
central
executive
as
noted
here
has
been
criticised
as
inadequate
and
vague
.

Working
memory
is
also
the
premise
for
what
allows
us
to
do
everyday
activities
involving
thought
.
It
is
the
section
of
memory
where
we
carry
out
thought
processes
and
use
them
to
learn
and
reason
about
topics
.
One
of
the
key
concerns
of
older
adults
is
the
experience
of
memory
loss
,
especially
as
it
is
one
of
the
hallmark
symptoms
of
Alzheimer
's
disease
.
However
,
memory
loss
is
qualitatively
different
in
normal
aging
from
the
kind
of
memory
loss
associated
with
a
diagnosis
of
Alzheimer
's
(
Budson
&
Price
,
2005
)
.
Research
has
revealed
that
individuals
’
performance
on
memory
tasks
that
rely
on
frontal
regions
declines
with
age
.
Older
adults
tend
to
exhibit
deficits
on
tasks
that
involve
knowing
the
temporal
order
in
which
they
learned
information
;
source
memory
tasks
that
require
them
to
remember
the
specific
circumstances
or
context
in
which
they
learned
information
;
and
prospective
memory
tasks
that
involve
remembering
to
perform
an
act
at
a
future
time
.
Older
adults
can
manage
their
problems
with
prospective
memory
by
using
appointment
books
,
for
example
.
It
should
be
noted
that
although
6
-
month-olds
can
recall
information
over
the
short-term
,
they
have
difficulty
recalling
the
temporal
order
of
information
.
It
is
only
by
9
months
of
age
that
infants
can
recall
the
actions
of
a
two
-step
sequence
in
the
correct
temporal
order
-
that
is
,
recalling
step
1
and
then
step
2
.
In
other
words
,
when
asked
to
imitate
a
two
-step
action
sequence
(
such
as
putting
a
toy
car
in
the
base
and
pushing
in
the
plunger
to
make
the
toy
roll
to
the
other
end
)
,
9
-
month-olds
tend
to
imitate
the
actions
of
the
sequence
in
the
correct
order
(
step
1
and
then
step
2
)
.
Younger
infants
(
6
-
month-olds
)
can
only
recall
one
step
of
a
two
-step
sequence
.
Researchers
have
suggested
that
these
age
differences
are
probably
due
to
the
fact
that
the
dentate
gyrus
of
the
hippocampus
and
the
frontal
components
of
the
neural
network
are
not
fully
developed
at
the
age
of
6
-
months
.
Declarative
memory
can
be
further
sub-divided
into
semantic
memory
,
concerning
principles
and
facts
taken
independent
of
context
;
and
episodic
memory
,
concerning
information
specific
to
a
particular
context
,
such
as
a
time
and
place
.
Semantic
memory
allows
the
encoding
of
abstract
knowledge
about
the
world
,
such
as
"
Paris
is
the
capital
of
France
"
.
Episodic
memory
,
on
the
other
hand
,
is
used
for
more
personal
memories
,
such
as
the
sensations
,
emotions
,
and
personal
associations
of
a
particular
place
or
time
.
Episodic
memories
often
reflect
the
"
firsts
"
in
life
such
as
a
first
kiss
,
first
day
of
school
or
first
time
winning
a
championship
.
These
are
key
events
in
one
's
life
that
can
be
remembered
clearly
.
Autobiographical
memory
-
memory
for
particular
events
within
one
's
own
life
-
is
generally
viewed
as
either
equivalent
to
,
or
a
subset
of
,
episodic
memory
.
Visual
memory
is
part
of
memory
preserving
some
characteristics
of
our
senses
pertaining
to
visual
experience
.
One
is
able
to
place
in
memory
information
that
resembles
objects
,
places
,
animals
or
people
in
sort
of
a
mental
image
.
Visual
memory
can
result
in
priming
and
it
is
assumed
some
kind
of
perceptual
representational
system
underlies
this
phenomenon
.

Stress
has
a
significant
effect
on
memory
formation
and
learning
.
In
response
to
stressful
situations
,
the
brain
releases
hormones
and
neurotransmitters
(
ex.
glucocorticoids
and
catecholamines
)
which
affect
memory
encoding
processes
in
the
hippocampus
.
Behavioural
research
on
animals
shows
that
chronic
stress
produces
adrenal
hormones
which
impact
the
hippocampal
structure
in
the
brains
of
rats
.
An
experimental
study
by
German
cognitive
psychologists
L.
Schwabe
and
O
.
Wolf
demonstrates
how
learning
under
stress
also
decreases
memory
recall
in
humans
.
In
this
study
,
48
healthy
female
and
male
university
students
participated
in
either
a
stress
test
or
a
control
group
.
Those
randomly
assigned
to
the
stress
test
group
had
a
hand
immersed
in
ice
cold
water
(
the
reputable
SECPT
or
‘
Socially
Evaluated
Cold
Pressor
Test
’
)
for
up
to
three
minutes
,
while
being
monitored
and
videotaped
.
Both
the
stress
and
control
groups
were
then
presented
with
32
words
to
memorize
.
Twenty
-
four
hours
later
,
both
groups
were
tested
to
see
how
many
words
they
could
remember
(
free
recall
)
as
well
as
how
many
they
could
recognize
from
a
larger
list
of
words
(
recognition
performance
)
.
The
results
showed
a
clear
impairment
of
memory
performance
in
the
stress
test
group
,
who
recalled
30
%
fewer
words
than
the
control
group
.
The
researchers
suggest
that
stress
experienced
during
learning
distracts
people
by
diverting
their
attention
during
the
memory
encoding
process
.
Interference
can
hamper
memorization
and
retrieval
.
There
is
retroactive
interference
,
when
learning
new
information
makes
it
harder
to
recall
old
information
and
proactive
interference
,
where
prior
learning
disrupts
recall
of
new
information
.
Although
interference
can
lead
to
forgetting
,
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
there
are
situations
when
old
information
can
facilitate
learning
of
new
information
.
Knowing
Latin
,
for
instance
,
can
help
an
individual
learn
a
related
language
such
as
French
–
this
phenomenon
is
known
as
positive
transfer
.
Up
until
the
middle
of
the
1980s
it
was
assumed
that
infants
could
not
encode
,
retain
,
and
retrieve
information
.
A
growing
body
of
research
now
indicates
that
infants
as
young
as
6
-
months
can
recall
information
after
a
24
-
hour
delay
.
Furthermore
,
research
has
revealed
that
as
infants
grow
older
they
can
store
information
for
longer
periods
of
time
;
6
-
month-olds
can
recall
information
after
a
24
-
hour
period
,
9
-
month-olds
after
up
to
five
weeks
,
and
20
-
month-olds
after
as
long
as
twelve
months
.
In
addition
,
studies
have
shown
that
with
age
,
infants
can
store
information
faster
.
Whereas
14
-
month-olds
can
recall
a
three
-step
sequence
after
being
exposed
to
it
once
,
6
-
month-olds
need
approximately
six
exposures
in
order
to
be
able
to
remember
it
.
Brain
areas
involved
in
the
neuroanatomy
of
memory
such
as
the
hippocampus
,
the
amygdala
,
the
striatum
,
or
the
mammillary
bodies
are
thought
to
be
involved
in
specific
types
of
memory
.
For
example
,
the
hippocampus
is
believed
to
be
involved
in
spatial
learning
and
declarative
learning
,
while
the
amygdala
is
thought
to
be
involved
in
emotional
memory
.
Damage
to
certain
areas
in
patients
and
animal
models
and
subsequent
memory
deficits
is
a
primary
source
of
information
.
However
,
rather
than
implicating
a
specific
area
,
it
could
be
that
damage
to
adjacent
areas
,
or
to
a
pathway
traveling
through
the
area
is
actually
responsible
for
the
observed
deficit
.
Further
,
it
is
not
sufficient
to
describe
memory
,
and
its
counterpart
,
learning
,
as
solely
dependent
on
specific
brain
regions
.
Learning
and
memory
are
attributed
to
changes
in
neuronal
synapses
,
thought
to
be
mediated
by
long-term
potentiation
and
long-term
depression
.
The
more
long
term
the
exposure
to
stress
is
,
the
more
impact
it
may
have
.
However
,
short
term
exposure
to
stress
also
causes
impairment
in
memory
by
interfering
with
the
function
of
the
hippocampus
.
Research
shows
that
subjects
placed
in
a
stressful
situation
for
a
short
amount
of
time
still
have
blood
glucocorticoid
levels
that
have
increased
drastically
when
measured
after
the
exposure
is
completed
.
When
subjects
are
asked
to
complete
a
learning
task
after
short
term
exposure
they
have
often
difficulties
.
Prenatal
stress
also
hinders
the
ability
to
learn
and
memorize
by
disrupting
the
development
of
the
hippocampus
and
can
lead
to
unestablished
long
term
potentiation
in
the
offspring
of
severely
stressed
parents
.
Although
the
stress
is
applied
prenatally
,
the
offspring
show
increased
levels
of
glucocorticoids
when
they
are
subjected
to
stress
later
on
in
life
.
Stressful
life
experiences
may
be
a
cause
of
memory
loss
as
a
person
ages
.
Glucocorticoids
that
are
released
during
stress
damage
neurons
that
are
located
in
the
hippocampal
region
of
the
brain
.
Therefore
,
the
more
stressful
situations
that
someone
encounters
,
the
more
susceptible
they
are
to
memory
loss
later
on
.
The
CA1
neurons
found
in
the
hippocampus
are
destroyed
due
to
glucocorticoids
decreasing
the
release
of
glucose
and
the
reuptake
of
glutamate
.
This
high
level
of
extracellular
glutamate
allow
calcium
to
enter
NMDA
receptors
which
in
return
kills
neurons
.
Stressful
life
experiences
can
also
cause
repression
of
memories
where
a
person
moves
an
unbearable
memory
to
the
unconscious
mind
.
This
directly
relates
to
traumatic
events
in
one
's
past
such
as
kidnappings
,
being
prisoners
of
war
or
sexual
abuse
as
a
child
.
Sleep
does
not
affect
acquisition
or
recall
while
one
is
awake
.
Therefore
,
sleep
has
the
greatest
effect
on
memory
consolidation
.
During
sleep
,
the
neural
connections
in
the
brain
are
strengthened
.
This
enhances
the
brain
’s
abilities
to
stabilize
and
retain
memories
.
There
have
been
several
studies
which
show
that
sleep
improves
the
retention
of
memory
,
as
memories
are
enhanced
through
active
consolidation
.
System
consolidation
takes
place
during
slow
-wave
sleep
(
SWS
)
.
This
process
implicates
that
memories
are
reactivated
during
sleep
,
but
that
the
process
does
n’t
enhance
every
memory
.
It
also
implicates
that
qualitative
changes
are
made
to
the
memories
when
they
are
transferred
to
long
-
term
store
during
sleep
.
When
you
are
sleeping
,
the
hippocampus
replays
the
events
of
the
day
for
the
neocortex
.
The
neocortex
then
reviews
and
processes
memories
,
which
moves
them
into
long-term
memory
.
When
you
do
not
get
enough
sleep
it
makes
it
more
difficult
to
learn
as
these
neural
connections
are
not
as
strong
,
resulting
in
a
lower
retention
rate
of
memories
.
Sleep
deprivation
makes
it
harder
to
focus
,
resulting
in
inefficient
learning
.
Furthermore
,
some
studies
have
shown
that
sleep
deprivation
can
lead
to
false
memories
as
the
memories
are
not
properly
transferred
to
long-term
memory
.
Therefore
,
it
is
important
to
get
the
proper
amount
of
sleep
so
that
memory
can
function
at
the
highest
level
.
One
of
the
primary
functions
of
sleep
is
thought
to
be
the
improvement
of
the
consolidation
of
information
,
as
several
studies
have
demonstrated
that
memory
depends
on
getting
sufficient
sleep
between
training
and
test
.
Additionally
,
data
obtained
from
neuroimaging
studies
have
shown
activation
patterns
in
the
sleeping
brain
that
mirror
those
recorded
during
the
learning
of
tasks
from
the
previous
day
,
suggesting
that
new
memories
may
be
solidified
through
such
rehearsal
.
A
UCLA
research
study
published
in
the
June
2006
issue
of
the
American
Journal
of
Geriatric
Psychiatry
found
that
people
can
improve
cognitive
function
and
brain
efficiency
through
simple
lifestyle
changes
such
as
incorporating
memory
exercises
,
healthy
eating
,
physical
fitness
and
stress
reduction
into
their
daily
lives
.
This
study
examined
17
subjects
,
(
average
age
53
)
with
normal
memory
performance
.
Eight
subjects
were
asked
to
follow
a
"
brain
healthy
"
diet
,
relaxation
,
physical
,
and
mental
exercise
(
brain
teasers
and
verbal
memory
training
techniques
)
.
After
14
days
,
they
showed
greater
word
fluency
(
not
memory
)
compared
to
their
baseline
performance
.
No
long
term
follow
up
was
conducted
,
it
is
therefore
unclear
if
this
intervention
has
lasting
effects
on
memory
.
Much
of
the
current
knowledge
of
memory
has
come
from
studying
memory
disorders
,
particularly
amnesia
.
Loss
of
memory
is
known
as
amnesia
.
Amnesia
can
result
from
extensive
damage
to
:
(
a
)
the
regions
of
the
medial
temporal
lobe
,
such
as
the
hippocampus
,
dentate
gyrus
,
subiculum
,
amygdala
,
the
parahippocampal
,
entorhinal
,
and
perirhinal
cortices
or
the
(
b
)
midline
diencephalic
region
,
specifically
the
dorsomedial
nucleus
of
the
thalamus
and
the
mammillary
bodies
of
the
hypothalamus
.
There
are
many
sorts
of
amnesia
,
and
by
studying
their
different
forms
,
it
has
become
possible
to
observe
apparent
defects
in
individual
sub-systems
of
the
brain
's
memory
systems
,
and
thus
hypothesize
their
function
in
the
normally
working
brain
.
Other
neurological
disorders
such
as
Alzheimer
's
disease
and
Parkinson
's
disease
can
also
affect
memory
and
cognition
.
Hyperthymesia
,
or
hyperthymesic
syndrome
,
is
a
disorder
that
affects
an
individual
's
autobiographical
memory
,
essentially
meaning
that
they
cannot
forget
small
details
that
otherwise
would
not
be
stored
.
Korsakoff
's
syndrome
,
also
known
as
Korsakoff
's
psychosis
,
amnesic-confabulatory
syndrome
,
is
an
organic
brain
disease
that
adversely
affects
memory
by
widespread
loss
or
shrinkage
of
neurons
within
the
prefrontal
cortex
.
Physical
exercise
,
particularly
continuous
aerobic
exercises
such
as
running
,
cycling
and
swimming
,
has
many
cognitive
benefits
and
effects
on
the
brain
.
Influences
on
the
brain
include
increases
in
neurotransmitter
levels
,
improved
oxygen
and
nutrient
delivery
,
and
increased
neurogenesis
in
the
hippocampus
.
The
effects
of
exercise
on
memory
have
important
implications
for
improving
children
's
academic
performance
,
maintaining
mental
abilities
in
old
age
,
and
the
prevention
and
potential
cure
of
neurological
diseases
.
However
,
memory
performance
can
be
enhanced
when
material
is
linked
to
the
learning
context
,
even
when
learning
occurs
under
stress
.
A
separate
study
by
cognitive
psychologists
Schwabe
and
Wolf
shows
that
when
retention
testing
is
done
in
a
context
similar
to
or
congruent
with
the
original
learning
task
(
i.e.
,
in
the
same
room
)
,
memory
impairment
and
the
detrimental
effects
of
stress
on
learning
can
be
attenuated
.
Seventy
-
two
healthy
female
and
male
university
students
,
randomly
assigned
to
the
SECPT
stress
test
or
to
a
control
group
,
were
asked
to
remember
the
locations
of
15
pairs
of
picture
cards
–
a
computerized
version
of
the
card
game
"
Concentration
"
or
"
Memory
"
.
The
room
in
which
the
experiment
took
place
was
infused
with
the
scent
of
vanilla
,
as
odour
is
a
strong
cue
for
memory
.
Retention
testing
took
place
the
following
day
,
either
in
the
same
room
with
the
vanilla
scent
again
present
,
or
in
a
different
room
without
the
fragrance
.
The
memory
performance
of
subjects
who
experienced
stress
during
the
object-location
task
decreased
significantly
when
they
were
tested
in
an
unfamiliar
room
without
the
vanilla
scent
(
an
incongruent
context
)
;
however
,
the
memory
performance
of
stressed
subjects
showed
no
impairment
when
they
were
tested
in
the
original
room
with
the
vanilla
scent
(
a
congruent
context
)
.
All
participants
in
the
experiment
,
both
stressed
and
unstressed
,
performed
faster
when
the
learning
and
retrieval
contexts
were
similar
.
Interestingly
,
research
has
revealed
that
asking
individuals
to
repeatedly
imagine
actions
that
they
have
never
performed
or
events
that
they
have
never
experienced
could
result
in
false
memories
.
For
instance
,
Goff
and
Roediger
(
1998
)
asked
participants
to
imagine
that
they
performed
an
act
(
e.g.
,
break
a
toothpick
)
and
then
later
asked
them
whether
they
had
done
such
a
thing
.
Findings
revealed
that
those
participants
who
repeatedly
imagined
performing
such
an
act
were
more
likely
to
think
that
they
had
actually
performed
that
act
during
the
first
session
of
the
experiment
.
Similarly
,
Garry
and
her
colleagues
(
1996
)
asked
college
students
to
report
how
certain
they
were
that
they
experienced
a
number
of
events
as
children
(
e.g.
,
broke
a
window
with
their
hand
)
and
then
two
weeks
later
asked
them
to
imagine
four
of
those
events
.
The
researchers
found
that
one
-fourth
of
the
students
asked
to
imagine
the
four
events
reported
that
they
had
actually
experienced
such
events
as
children
.
That
is
,
when
asked
to
imagine
the
events
they
were
more
confident
that
they
experienced
the
events
.
Although
people
often
think
that
memory
operates
like
recording
equipment
,
it
is
not
the
case
.
The
molecular
mechanisms
underlying
the
induction
and
maintenance
of
memory
are
very
dynamic
and
comprise
distinct
phases
covering
a
time
window
from
seconds
to
even
a
lifetime
.
In
fact
,
research
has
revealed
that
our
memories
are
constructed
.
People
can
construct
their
memories
when
they
encode
them
and
/
or
when
they
recall
them
.
To
illustrate
,
consider
a
classic
study
conducted
by
Elizabeth
Loftus
and
John
Palmer
(
1974
)
in
which
people
were
instructed
to
watch
a
film
of
a
traffic
accident
and
then
asked
about
what
they
saw
.
The
researchers
found
that
the
people
who
were
asked
,
"
How
fast
were
the
cars
going
when
they
smashed
into
each
other
?
"
gave
higher
estimates
than
those
who
were
asked
,
"
How
fast
were
the
cars
going
when
they
hit
each
other
?
"
Furthermore
,
when
asked
a
week
later
whether
they
have
seen
broken
glass
in
the
film
,
those
who
had
been
asked
the
question
with
smashed
were
twice
more
likely
to
report
that
they
have
seen
broken
glass
than
those
who
had
been
asked
the
question
with
hit
.
There
was
no
broken
glass
depicted
in
the
film
.
Thus
,
the
wording
of
the
questions
distorted
viewers
’
memories
of
the
event
.
Importantly
,
the
wording
of
the
question
led
people
to
construct
different
memories
of
the
event
–
those
who
were
asked
the
question
with
smashed
recalled
a
more
serious
car
accident
than
they
had
actually
seen
.
The
findings
of
this
experiment
were
replicated
around
the
world
,
and
researchers
consistently
demonstrated
that
when
people
were
provided
with
misleading
information
they
tended
to
misremember
,
a
phenomenon
known
as
the
misinformation
effect
.
Memorization
is
a
method
of
learning
that
allows
an
individual
to
recall
information
verbatim
.
Rote
learning
is
the
method
most
often
used
.
Methods
of
memorizing
things
have
been
the
subject
of
much
discussion
over
the
years
with
some
writers
,
such
as
Cosmos
Rossellius
using
visual
alphabets
.
The
spacing
effect
shows
that
an
individual
is
more
likely
to
remember
a
list
of
items
when
rehearsal
is
spaced
over
an
extended
period
of
time
.
In
contrast
to
this
is
cramming
:
an
intensive
memorization
in
a
short
period
of
time
.
Also
relevant
is
the
Zeigarnik
effect
which
states
that
people
remember
uncompleted
or
interrupted
tasks
better
than
completed
ones
.
The
so-called
Method
of
loci
uses
spatial
memory
to
memorize
non-spatial
information
.
By
the
1890s
the
profound
effect
of
adrenal
extracts
on
many
different
tissue
types
had
been
discovered
,
setting
off
a
search
both
for
the
mechanism
of
chemical
signalling
and
efforts
to
exploit
these
observations
for
the
development
of
new
drugs
.
The
blood
pressure
raising
and
vasoconstrictive
effects
of
adrenal
extracts
were
of
particular
interest
to
surgeons
as
hemostatic
agents
and
as
treatment
for
shock
,
and
a
number
of
companies
developed
products
based
on
adrenal
extracts
containing
varying
purities
of
the
active
substance
.
In
1897
John
Abel
of
Johns
Hopkins
University
identified
the
active
principle
as
epinephrine
,
which
he
isolated
in
an
impure
state
as
the
sulfate
salt
.
Industrial
chemist
Jokichi
Takamine
later
developed
a
method
for
obtaining
epinephrine
in
a
pure
state
,
and
licensed
the
technology
to
Parke
Davis
.
Parke
Davis
marketed
epinephrine
under
the
trade
name
Adrenalin
.
Injected
epinephrine
proved
to
be
especially
efficacious
for
the
acute
treatment
of
asthma
attacks
,
and
an
inhaled
version
was
sold
in
the
United
States
until
2011
(
Primatene
Mist
)
.
By
1929
epinephrine
had
been
formulated
into
an
inhaler
for
use
in
the
treatment
of
nasal
congestion
.
While
highly
effective
,
the
requirement
for
injection
limited
the
use
of
norepinephrine
[
clarification
needed
]
and
orally
active
derivatives
were
sought
.
A
structurally
similar
compound
,
ephedrine
,
was
identified
by
Japanese
chemists
in
the
Ma
Huang
plant
and
marketed
by
Eli
Lilly
as
an
oral
treatment
for
asthma
.
Following
the
work
of
Henry
Dale
and
George
Barger
at
Burroughs
-
Wellcome
,
academic
chemist
Gordon
Alles
synthesized
amphetamine
and
tested
it
in
asthma
patients
in
1929
.
The
drug
proved
to
have
only
modest
anti-asthma
effects
,
but
produced
sensations
of
exhilaration
and
palpitations
.
Amphetamine
was
developed
by
Smith
,
Kline
and
French
as
a
nasal
decongestant
under
the
trade
name
Benzedrine
Inhaler
.
Amphetamine
was
eventually
developed
for
the
treatment
of
narcolepsy
,
post-encepheletic
parkinsonism
,
and
mood
elevation
in
depression
and
other
psychiatric
indications
.
It
received
approval
as
a
New
and
Nonofficial
Remedy
from
the
American
Medical
Association
for
these
uses
in
1937
and
remained
in
common
use
for
depression
until
the
development
of
tricyclic
antidepressants
in
the
1960s
.
A
series
of
experiments
performed
from
the
late
1800s
to
the
early
1900s
revealed
that
diabetes
is
caused
by
the
absence
of
a
substance
normally
produced
by
the
pancreas
.
In
1869
,
Oskar
Minkowski
and
Joseph
von
Mering
found
that
diabetes
could
be
induced
in
dogs
by
surgical
removal
of
the
pancreas
.
In
1921
,
Canadian
professor
Frederick
Banting
and
his
student
Charles
Best
repeated
this
study
,
and
found
that
injections
of
pancreatic
extract
reversed
the
symptoms
produced
by
pancreas
removal
.
Soon
,
the
extract
was
demonstrated
to
work
in
people
,
but
development
of
insulin
therapy
as
a
routine
medical
procedure
was
delayed
by
difficulties
in
producing
the
material
in
sufficient
quantity
and
with
reproducible
purity
.
The
researchers
sought
assistance
from
industrial
collaborators
at
Eli
Lilly
and
Co.
based
on
the
company
's
experience
with
large
scale
purification
of
biological
materials
.
Chemist
George
Walden
of
Eli
Lilly
and
Company
found
that
careful
adjustment
of
the
pH
of
the
extract
allowed
a
relatively
pure
grade
of
insulin
to
be
produced
.
Under
pressure
from
Toronto
University
and
a
potential
patent
challenge
by
academic
scientists
who
had
independently
developed
a
similar
purification
method
,
an
agreement
was
reached
for
non-exclusive
production
of
insulin
by
multiple
companies
.
Prior
to
the
discovery
and
widespread
availability
of
insulin
therapy
the
life
expectancy
of
diabetics
was
only
a
few
months
.
In
1903
Hermann
Emil
Fischer
and
Joseph
von
Mering
disclosed
their
discovery
that
diethylbarbituric
acid
,
formed
from
the
reaction
of
diethylmalonic
acid
,
phosphorus
oxychloride
and
urea
,
induces
sleep
in
dogs
.
The
discovery
was
patented
and
licensed
to
Bayer
pharmaceuticals
,
which
marketed
the
compound
under
the
trade
name
Veronal
as
a
sleep
aid
beginning
in
1904
.
Systematic
investigations
of
the
effect
of
structural
changes
on
potency
and
duration
of
action
led
to
the
discovery
of
phenobarbital
at
Bayer
in
1911
and
the
discovery
of
its
potent
anti-epileptic
activity
in
1912
.
Phenobarbital
was
among
the
most
widely
used
drugs
for
the
treatment
of
epilepsy
through
the
1970s
,
and
as
of
2014
,
remains
on
the
World
Health
Organizations
list
of
essential
medications
.
The
1950s
and
1960s
saw
increased
awareness
of
the
addictive
properties
and
abuse
potential
of
barbiturates
and
amphetamines
and
led
to
increasing
restrictions
on
their
use
and
growing
government
oversight
of
prescribers
.
Today
,
amphetamine
is
largely
restricted
to
use
in
the
treatment
of
attention
deficit
disorder
and
phenobarbital
in
the
treatment
of
epilepsy
.
In
1911
arsphenamine
,
the
first
synthetic
anti-infective
drug
,
was
developed
by
Paul
Ehrlich
and
chemist
Alfred
Bertheim
of
the
Institute
of
Experimental
Therapy
in
Berlin
.
The
drug
was
given
the
commercial
name
Salvarsan
.
Ehrlich
,
noting
both
the
general
toxicity
of
arsenic
and
the
selective
absorption
of
certain
dyes
by
bacteria
,
hypothesized
that
an
arsenic-containing
dye
with
similar
selective
absorption
properties
could
be
used
to
treat
bacterial
infections
.
Arsphenamine
was
prepared
as
part
of
a
campaign
to
synthesize
a
series
of
such
compounds
,
and
found
to
exhibit
partially
selective
toxicity
.
Arsphenamine
proved
to
be
the
first
effective
treatment
for
syphilis
,
a
disease
which
prior
to
that
time
was
incurable
and
led
inexorably
to
severe
skin
ulceration
,
neurological
damage
,
and
death
.

The
modern
pharmaceutical
industry
traces
its
roots
to
two
sources
.
The
first
of
these
were
local
apothecaries
that
expanded
from
their
traditional
role
distributing
botanical
drugs
such
as
morphine
and
quinine
to
wholesale
manufacture
in
the
mid
1800s
.
Rational
drug
discovery
from
plants
started
particularly
with
the
isolation
of
morphine
,
analgesic
and
sleep
-
inducing
agent
from
opium
,
by
the
German
apothecary
assistant
Friedrich
Sertürner
,
who
named
the
compound
after
the
Greek
god
of
dreams
,
Morpheus
.
Multinational
corporations
including
Merck
,
Hoffman
-La
Roche
,
Burroughs
-
Wellcome
(
now
part
of
Glaxo
Smith
Kline
)
,
Abbott
Laboratories
,
Eli
Lilly
and
Upjohn
(
now
part
of
Pfizer
)
began
as
local
apothecary
shops
in
the
mid-1800s
.
By
the
late
1880s
,
German
dye
manufacturers
had
perfected
the
purification
of
individual
organic
compounds
from
coal
tar
and
other
mineral
sources
and
had
also
established
rudimentary
methods
in
organic
chemical
synthesis
.
The
development
of
synthetic
chemical
methods
allowed
scientists
to
systematically
vary
the
structure
of
chemical
substances
,
and
growth
in
the
emerging
science
of
pharmacology
expanded
their
ability
to
evaluate
the
biological
effects
of
these
structural
changes
.
Ehrlich
’s
approach
of
systematically
varying
the
chemical
structure
of
synthetic
compounds
and
measuring
the
effects
of
these
changes
on
biological
activity
was
pursued
broadly
by
industrial
scientists
,
including
Bayer
scientists
Josef
Klarer
,
Fritz
Mietzsch
,
and
Gerhard
Domagk
.
This
work
,
also
based
in
the
testing
of
compounds
available
from
the
German
dye
industry
,
led
to
the
development
of
Prontosil
,
the
first
representative
of
the
sulfonamide
class
of
antibiotics
.
Compared
to
arsphenamine
,
the
sulfonamides
had
a
broader
spectrum
of
activity
and
were
far
less
toxic
,
rendering
them
useful
for
infections
caused
by
pathogens
such
as
streptococci
.
In
1939
,
Domagk
received
the
Nobel
Prize
in
Medicine
for
this
discovery
.
Nonetheless
,
the
dramatic
decrease
in
deaths
from
infectious
diseases
that
occurred
prior
to
World
War
II
was
primarily
the
result
of
improved
public
health
measures
such
as
clean
water
and
less
crowded
housing
,
and
the
impact
of
anti-infective
drugs
and
vaccines
was
significant
mainly
after
World
War
II
.
Early
progress
toward
the
development
of
vaccines
occurred
throughout
this
period
,
primarily
in
the
form
of
academic
and
government
-funded
basic
research
directed
toward
the
identification
of
the
pathogens
responsible
for
common
communicable
diseases
.
In
1885
Louis
Pasteur
and
Pierre
Paul
Émile
Roux
created
the
first
rabies
vaccine
.
The
first
diphtheria
vaccines
were
produced
in
1914
from
a
mixture
of
diphtheria
toxin
and
antitoxin
(
produced
from
the
serum
of
an
inoculated
animal
)
,
but
the
safety
of
the
inoculation
was
marginal
and
it
was
not
widely
used
.
The
United
States
recorded
206,000
cases
of
diphtheria
in
1921
resulting
in
15,520
deaths
.
In
1923
parallel
efforts
by
Gaston
Ramon
at
the
Pasteur
Institute
and
Alexander
Glenny
at
the
Wellcome
Research
Laboratories
(
later
part
of
GlaxoSmithKline
)
led
to
the
discovery
that
a
safer
vaccine
could
be
produced
by
treating
diphtheria
toxin
with
formaldehyde
.
In
1944
,
Maurice
Hilleman
of
Squibb
Pharmaceuticals
developed
the
first
vaccine
against
Japanese
encephelitis
.
Hilleman
would
later
move
to
Merck
where
he
would
play
a
key
role
in
the
development
of
vaccines
against
measles
,
mumps
,
chickenpox
,
rubella
,
hepatitis
A
,
hepatitis
B
,
and
meningitis
.
In
1937
over
100
people
died
after
ingesting
"
Elixir
Sulfanilamide
"
manufactured
by
S.E.
Massengill
Company
of
Tennessee
.
The
product
was
formulated
in
diethylene
glycol
,
a
highly
toxic
solvent
that
is
now
widely
used
as
antifreeze
.
Under
the
laws
extant
at
that
time
,
prosecution
of
the
manufacturer
was
possible
only
under
the
technicality
that
the
product
had
been
called
an
"
elixir
"
,
which
literally
implied
a
solution
in
ethanol
.
In
response
to
this
episode
,
the
U.S.
Congress
passed
the
Federal
Food
,
Drug
,
and
Cosmetic
Act
of
1938
,
which
for
the
first
time
required
pre-market
demonstration
of
safety
before
a
drug
could
be
sold
,
and
explicitly
prohibited
false
therapeutic
claims
.
The
aftermath
of
World
War
II
saw
an
explosion
in
the
discovery
of
new
classes
of
antibacterial
drugs
including
the
cephalosporins
(
developed
by
Eli
Lilly
based
on
the
seminal
work
of
Giuseppe
Brotzu
and
Edward
Abraham
)
,
streptomycin
(
discovered
during
a
Merck
-
funded
research
program
in
Selman
Waksman
's
laboratory
)
,
the
tetracyclines
(
discovered
at
Lederle
Laboratories
,
now
a
part
of
Pfizer
)
,
erythromycin
(
discovered
at
Eli
Lilly
and
Co.
)
and
their
extension
to
an
increasingly
wide
range
of
bacterial
pathogens
.
Streptomycin
,
discovered
during
a
Merck-
funded
research
program
in
Selman
Waksman
's
laboratory
at
Rutgers
in
1943
,
became
the
first
effective
treatment
for
tuberculosis
.
At
the
time
of
its
discovery
,
sanitoriums
for
the
isolation
of
tuberculosis
-infected
people
were
an
ubiquitous
feature
of
cities
in
developed
countries
,
with
50
%
dying
within
5
years
of
admission
.
During
the
years
1940
-
1955
,
the
rate
of
decline
in
the
U.S.
death
rate
accelerated
from
2
%
per
year
to
8
%
per
year
,
then
returned
to
the
historical
rate
of
2
%
per
year
.
The
dramatic
decline
in
the
immediate
post-war
years
has
been
attributed
to
the
rapid
development
of
new
treatments
and
vaccines
for
infectious
disease
that
occurred
during
these
years
.
Vaccine
development
continued
to
accelerate
,
with
the
most
notable
achievement
of
the
period
being
Jonas
Salk
's
1954
development
of
the
polio
vaccine
under
the
funding
of
the
non-profit
National
Foundation
for
Infantile
Paralysis
.
The
vaccine
process
was
never
patented
,
but
was
instead
given
to
pharmaceutical
companies
to
manufacture
as
a
low-cost
generic
.
In
1960
Maurice
Hilleman
of
Merck
Sharp
&
Dohme
identified
the
SV40
virus
,
which
was
later
shown
to
cause
tumors
in
many
mammalian
species
.
It
was
later
determined
that
SV40
was
present
as
a
contaminant
in
polio
vaccine
lots
that
had
been
administered
to
90
%
of
the
children
in
the
United
States
.
The
contamination
appears
to
have
originated
both
in
the
original
cell
stock
and
in
monkey
tissue
used
for
production
.
In
2004
the
United
States
Cancer
Institute
announced
that
it
had
concluded
that
SV40
is
not
associated
with
cancer
in
people
.
On
2
July
2012
,
GlaxoSmithKline
pleaded
guilty
to
criminal
charges
and
agreed
to
a
$
3
billion
settlement
of
the
largest
health
-
care
fraud
case
in
the
U.S.
and
the
largest
payment
by
a
drug
company
.
The
settlement
is
related
to
the
company
's
illegal
promotion
of
prescription
drugs
,
its
failure
to
report
safety
data
,
bribing
doctors
,
and
promoting
medicines
for
uses
for
which
they
were
not
licensed
.
The
drugs
involved
were
Paxil
,
Wellbutrin
,
Advair
,
Lamictal
,
and
Zofran
for
off-label
,
non-covered
uses
.
Those
and
the
drugs
Imitrex
,
Lotronex
,
Flovent
,
and
Valtrex
were
involved
in
the
kickback
scheme
.
In
the
US
,
starting
in
2013
,
under
the
Physician
Financial
Transparency
Reports
(
part
of
the
Sunshine
Act
)
,
the
Centers
for
Medicare
&
Medicaid
Services
has
to
collect
information
from
applicable
manufacturers
and
group
purchasing
organizations
in
order
to
report
information
about
their
financial
relationships
with
physicians
and
hospitals
.
Data
are
made
public
in
the
Centers
for
Medicare
&
Medicaid
Services
website
.
The
expectation
is
that
relationship
between
doctors
and
Pharmaceutical
industry
will
become
fully
transparent
.
A
Federal
Trade
Commission
report
issued
in
1958
attempted
to
quantify
the
effect
of
antibiotic
development
on
American
public
health
.
The
report
found
that
over
the
period
1946
-
1955
,
there
was
a
42
%
drop
in
the
incidence
of
diseases
for
which
antibiotics
were
effective
and
only
a
20
%
drop
in
those
for
which
antibiotics
were
not
effective
.
The
report
concluded
that
"
it
appears
that
the
use
of
antibiotics
,
early
diagnosis
,
and
other
factors
have
limited
the
epidemic
spread
and
thus
the
number
of
these
diseases
which
have
occurred
"
.
The
study
further
examined
mortality
rates
for
eight
common
diseases
for
which
antibiotics
offered
effective
therapy
(
syphilis
,
tuberculosis
,
dysentery
,
scarlet
fever
,
whooping
cough
,
meningococcal
infections
,
and
pneumonia
)
,
and
found
a
56
%
decline
over
the
same
period
.
Notable
among
these
was
a
75
%
decline
in
deaths
due
to
tuberculosis
.
In
March
2001
,
40
multi-national
pharmaceutical
companies
brought
litigation
against
South
Africa
for
its
Medicines
Act
,
which
allowed
the
generic
production
of
antiretroviral
drugs
(
ARVs
)
for
treating
HIV
,
despite
the
fact
that
these
drugs
were
on-patent
.
HIV
was
and
is
an
epidemic
in
South
Africa
,
and
ARVs
at
the
time
cost
between
10,000
and
15,000
USD
per
patient
per
year
.
This
was
unaffordable
for
most
South
African
citizens
,
and
so
the
South
African
government
committed
to
providing
ARVs
at
prices
closer
to
what
people
could
afford
.
To
do
so
,
they
would
need
to
ignore
the
patents
on
drugs
and
produce
generics
within
the
country
(
using
a
compulsory
license
)
,
or
import
them
from
abroad
.
After
international
protest
in
favour
of
public
health
rights
(
including
the
collection
of
250,000
signatures
by
MSF
)
,
the
governments
of
several
developed
countries
(
including
The
Netherlands
,
Germany
,
France
,
and
later
the
US
)
backed
the
South
African
government
,
and
the
case
was
dropped
in
April
of
that
year
.
Prior
to
the
20th
century
drugs
were
generally
produced
by
small
scale
manufacturers
with
little
regulatory
control
over
manufacturing
or
claims
of
safety
and
efficacy
.
To
the
extent
that
such
laws
did
exist
,
enforcement
was
lax
.
In
the
United
States
,
increased
regulation
of
vaccines
and
other
biological
drugs
was
spurred
by
tetanus
outbreaks
and
deaths
caused
by
the
distribution
of
contaminated
smallpox
vaccine
and
diphtheria
antitoxin
.
The
Biologics
Control
Act
of
1902
required
that
federal
government
grant
premarket
approval
for
every
biological
drug
and
for
the
process
and
facility
producing
such
drugs
.
This
was
followed
in
1906
by
the
Pure
Food
and
Drugs
Act
,
which
forbade
the
interstate
distribution
of
adulterated
or
misbranded
foods
and
drugs
.
A
drug
was
considered
misbranded
if
it
contained
alcohol
,
morphine
,
opium
,
cocaine
,
or
any
of
several
other
potentially
dangerous
or
addictive
drugs
,
and
if
its
label
failed
to
indicate
the
quantity
or
proportion
of
such
drugs
.
The
government
's
attempts
to
use
the
law
to
prosecute
manufacturers
for
making
unsupported
claims
of
efficacy
were
undercut
by
a
Supreme
Court
ruling
restricting
the
federal
government
's
enforcement
powers
to
cases
of
incorrect
specification
of
the
drug
's
ingredients
.
Patents
have
been
criticized
in
the
developing
world
,
as
they
are
thought
to
reduce
access
to
existing
medicines
.
Reconciling
patents
and
universal
access
to
medicine
would
require
an
efficient
international
policy
of
price
discrimination
.
Moreover
,
under
the
TRIPS
agreement
of
the
World
Trade
Organization
,
countries
must
allow
pharmaceutical
products
to
be
patented
.
In
2001
,
the
WTO
adopted
the
Doha
Declaration
,
which
indicates
that
the
TRIPS
agreement
should
be
read
with
the
goals
of
public
health
in
mind
,
and
allows
some
methods
for
circumventing
pharmaceutical
monopolies
:
via
compulsory
licensing
or
parallel
imports
,
even
before
patent
expiration
.
Pharmaceutical
fraud
involves
deceptions
which
bring
financial
gain
to
a
pharmaceutical
company
.
It
affects
individuals
and
public
and
private
insurers
.
There
are
several
different
schemes
used
to
defraud
the
health
care
system
which
are
particular
to
the
pharmaceutical
industry
.
These
include
:
Good
Manufacturing
Practice
(
GMP
)
Violations
,
Off
Label
Marketing
,
Best
Price
Fraud
,
CME
Fraud
,
Medicaid
Price
Reporting
,
and
Manufactured
Compound
Drugs
.
Of
this
amount
$
2.5
billion
was
recovered
through
False
Claims
Act
cases
in
FY
2010
.
Examples
of
fraud
cases
include
the
GlaxoSmithKline
$
3
billion
settlement
,
Pfizer
$
2.3
billion
settlement
and
Merck
&
Co.
$
650
million
settlement
.
Damages
from
fraud
can
be
recovered
by
use
of
the
False
Claims
Act
,
most
commonly
under
the
qui
tam
provisions
which
rewards
an
individual
for
being
a
"
whistleblower
"
,
or
relator
(
law
)
.
A
2009
Cochrane
review
concluded
that
thiazide
antihypertensive
drugs
reduce
the
risk
of
death
(
RR
0.89
)
,
stroke
(
RR
0.63
)
,
coronary
heart
disease
(
RR
0.84
)
,
and
cardiovascular
events
(
RR
0.70
)
in
people
with
high
blood
pressure
.
In
the
ensuring
years
other
classes
of
antihypertensive
drug
were
developed
and
found
wide
acceptance
in
combination
therapy
,
including
loop
diuretics
(
Lasix
/
furosemide
,
Hoechst
Pharmaceuticals
,
1963
)
,
beta
blockers
(
ICI
Pharmaceuticals
,
1964
)
ACE
inhibitors
,
and
angiotensin
receptor
blockers
.
ACE
inhibitors
reduce
the
risk
of
new
onset
kidney
disease
[
RR
0.71
]
and
death
[
RR
0.84
]
in
diabetic
patients
,
irrespective
of
whether
they
have
hypertension
.
Others
have
argued
that
excessive
regulation
suppresses
therapeutic
innovation
,
and
that
the
current
cost
of
regulator-required
clinical
trials
prevents
the
full
exploitation
of
new
genetic
and
biological
knowledge
for
the
treatment
of
human
disease
.
A
2012
report
by
the
President
's
Council
of
Advisors
on
Science
and
Technology
made
several
key
recommendations
to
reduce
regulatory
burdens
to
new
drug
development
,
including
1
)
expanding
the
FDA
's
use
of
accelerated
approval
processes
,
2
)
creating
an
expedited
approval
pathway
for
drugs
intended
for
use
in
narrowly
defined
populations
,
and
3
)
undertaking
pilot
projects
designed
to
evaluate
the
feasibility
of
a
new
,
adaptive
drug
approval
process
.
In
1952
researchers
at
Ciba
discovered
the
first
orally
available
vasodilator
,
hydralazine
.
A
major
shortcoming
of
hydralazine
monotherapy
was
that
it
lost
its
effectiveness
over
time
(
tachyphylaxis
)
.
In
the
mid-1950s
Karl
H.
Beyer
,
James
M.
Sprague
,
John
E.
Baer
,
and
Frederick
C.
Novello
of
Merck
and
Co.
discovered
and
developed
chlorothiazide
,
which
remains
the
most
widely
used
antihypertensive
drug
today
.
This
development
was
associated
with
a
substantial
decline
in
the
mortality
rate
among
people
with
hypertension
.
The
inventors
were
recognized
by
a
Public
Health
Lasker
Award
in
1975
for
"
the
saving
of
untold
thousands
of
lives
and
the
alleviation
of
the
suffering
of
millions
of
victims
of
hypertension
"
.
In
the
U.S.
,
a
push
for
revisions
of
the
FD&C
Act
emerged
from
Congressional
hearings
led
by
Senator
Estes
Kefauver
of
Tennessee
in
1959
.
The
hearings
covered
a
wide
range
of
policy
issues
,
including
advertising
abuses
,
questionable
efficacy
of
drugs
,
and
the
need
for
greater
regulation
of
the
industry
.
While
momentum
for
new
legislation
temporarily
flagged
under
extended
debate
,
a
new
tragedy
emerged
that
underscored
the
need
for
more
comprehensive
regulation
and
provided
the
driving
force
for
the
passage
of
new
laws
.
Other
notable
new
vaccines
of
the
period
include
those
for
measles
(
1962
,
John
Franklin
Enders
of
Children
's
Medical
Center
Boston
,
later
refined
by
Maurice
Hilleman
at
Merck
)
,
Rubella
(
1969
,
Hilleman
,
Merck
)
and
mumps
(
1967
,
Hilleman
,
Merck
)
The
United
States
incidences
of
rubella
,
congenital
rubella
syndrome
,
measles
,
and
mumps
all
fell
by
>
95
%
in
the
immediate
aftermath
of
widespread
vaccination
.
The
first
20
years
of
licensed
measles
vaccination
in
the
U.S.
prevented
an
estimated
52
million
cases
of
the
disease
,
17,400
cases
of
mental
retardation
,
and
5,200
deaths
.
The
thalidomide
tragedy
resurrected
Kefauver
's
bill
to
enhance
drug
regulation
that
had
stalled
in
Congress
,
and
the
Kefauver
-Harris
Amendment
became
law
on
10
October
1962
.
Manufacturers
henceforth
had
to
prove
to
FDA
that
their
drugs
were
effective
as
well
as
safe
before
they
could
go
on
the
US
market
.
The
FDA
received
authority
to
regulate
advertising
of
prescription
drugs
and
to
establish
good
manufacturing
practices
.
The
law
required
that
all
drugs
introduced
between
1938
and
1962
had
to
be
effective
.
An
FDA
-
National
Academy
of
Sciences
collaborative
study
showed
that
nearly
40
percent
of
these
products
were
not
effective
.
A
similarly
comprehensive
study
of
over-
the-counter
products
began
ten
years
later
.
The
firm
continued
to
pressure
Kelsey
and
the
agency
to
approve
the
application
—
until
November
1961
,
when
the
drug
was
pulled
off
the
German
market
because
of
its
association
with
grave
congenital
abnormalities
.
Several
thousand
newborns
in
Europe
and
elsewhere
suffered
the
teratogenic
effects
of
thalidomide
.
Though
the
drug
was
never
approved
in
the
USA
,
the
firm
distributed
Kevadon
to
over
1,000
physicians
there
under
the
guise
of
investigational
use
.
Over
20,000
Americans
received
thalidomide
in
this
"
study
,
"
including
624
pregnant
patients
,
and
about
17
known
newborns
suffered
the
effects
of
the
drug.

Prior
to
the
second
world
war
,
birth
control
was
prohibited
in
many
countries
,
and
in
the
United
States
even
the
discussion
of
contraceptive
methods
sometimes
led
to
prosecution
under
Comstock
laws
.
The
history
of
the
development
of
oral
contraceptives
is
thus
closely
tied
to
the
birth
control
movement
and
the
efforts
of
activists
Margaret
Sanger
,
Mary
Dennett
,
and
Emma
Goldman
.
Based
on
fundamental
research
performed
by
Gregory
Pincus
and
synthetic
methods
for
progesterone
developed
by
Carl
Djerassi
at
Syntex
and
by
Frank
Colton
at
G.D.
Searle
&
Co.
,
the
first
oral
contraceptive
,
Enovid
,
was
developed
by
E.D.
Searle
and
Co.
and
approved
by
the
FDA
in
1960
.
The
original
formulation
incorporated
vastly
excessive
doses
of
hormones
,
and
caused
severe
side
effects
.
Nonetheless
,
by
1962
,
1.2
million
American
women
were
on
the
pill
,
and
by
1965
the
number
had
increased
to
6.5
million
.
The
availability
of
a
convenient
form
of
temporary
contraceptive
led
to
dramatic
changes
in
social
mores
including
expanding
the
range
of
lifestyle
options
available
to
women
,
reducing
the
reliance
of
women
on
men
for
contraceptive
practice
,
encouraging
the
delay
of
marriage
,
and
increasing
pre-marital
co-habitation
.
In
April
1994
,
the
results
of
a
Merck-sponsored
study
,
the
Scandinavian
Simvastatin
Survival
Study
,
were
announced
.
Researchers
tested
simvastatin
,
later
sold
by
Merck
as
Zocor
,
on
4,444
patients
with
high
cholesterol
and
heart
disease
.
After
five
years
,
the
study
concluded
the
patients
saw
a
35
%
reduction
in
their
cholesterol
,
and
their
chances
of
dying
of
a
heart
attack
were
reduced
by
42
%
.
In
1995
,
Zocor
and
Mevacor
both
made
Merck
over
US
$
1
billion

Drug
discovery
is
the
process
by
which
potential
drugs
are
discovered
or
designed
.
In
the
past
most
drugs
have
been
discovered
either
by
isolating
the
active
ingredient
from
traditional
remedies
or
by
serendipitous
discovery
.
Modern
biotechnology
often
focuses
on
understanding
the
metabolic
pathways
related
to
a
disease
state
or
pathogen
,
and
manipulating
these
pathways
using
molecular
biology
or
biochemistry
.
A
great
deal
of
early
-
stage
drug
discovery
has
traditionally
been
carried
out
by
universities
and
research
institutions
.
Drug
discovery
and
development
is
very
expensive
;
of
all
compounds
investigated
for
use
in
humans
only
a
small
fraction
are
eventually
approved
in
most
nations
by
government
appointed
medical
institutions
or
boards
,
who
have
to
approve
new
drugs
before
they
can
be
marketed
in
those
countries
.
In
2010
18
NMEs
(
New
Molecular
Entities
)
were
approved
and
three
biologics
by
the
FDA
,
or
21
in
total
,
which
is
down
from
26
in
2009
and
24
in
2008
.
On
the
other
hand
,
there
were
only
18
approvals
in
total
in
2007
and
22
back
in
2006
.
Since
2001
,
the
Center
for
Drug
Evaluation
and
Research
has
averaged
22.9
approvals
a
year
.
This
approval
comes
only
after
heavy
investment
in
pre-clinical
development
and
clinical
trials
,
as
well
as
a
commitment
to
ongoing
safety
monitoring
.
Drugs
which
fail
part
-
way
through
this
process
often
incur
large
costs
,
while
generating
no
revenue
in
return
.
If
the
cost
of
these
failed
drugs
is
taken
into
account
,
the
cost
of
developing
a
successful
new
drug
(
new
chemical
entity
,
or
NCE
)
,
has
been
estimated
at
about
1.3
billion
USD
(
not
including
marketing
expenses
)
.
Professors
Light
and
Lexchin
reported
in
2012
,
however
,
that
the
rate
of
approval
for
new
drugs
has
been
a
relatively
stable
average
rate
of
15
to
25
for
decades
.
Some
of
these
estimates
also
take
into
account
the
opportunity
cost
of
investing
capital
many
years
before
revenues
are
realized
(
see
Time-value
of
money
)
.
Because
of
the
very
long
time
needed
for
discovery
,
development
,
and
approval
of
pharmaceuticals
,
these
costs
can
accumulate
to
nearly
half
the
total
expense
.
A
direct
consequence
within
the
pharmaceutical
industry
value
chain
is
that
major
pharmaceutical
multinationals
tend
to
increasingly
outsource
risks
related
to
fundamental
research
,
which
somewhat
reshapes
the
industry
ecosystem
with
biotechnology
companies
playing
an
increasingly
important
role
,
and
overall
strategies
being
redefined
accordingly
.
Some
approved
drugs
,
such
as
those
based
on
re-formulation
of
an
existing
active
ingredient
(
also
referred
to
as
Line-extensions
)
are
much
less
expensive
to
develop
.
In
1971
,
Akira
Endo
,
a
Japanese
biochemist
working
for
the
pharmaceutical
company
Sankyo
,
identified
mevastatin
(
ML
-
236B
)
,
a
molecule
produced
by
the
fungus
Penicillium
citrinum
,
as
an
inhibitor
of
HMG
-
CoA
reductase
,
a
critical
enzyme
used
by
the
body
to
produce
cholesterol
.
Animal
trials
showed
very
good
inhibitory
effect
as
in
clinical
trials
,
however
a
long
term
study
in
dogs
found
toxic
effects
at
higher
doses
and
as
a
result
mevastatin
was
believed
to
be
too
toxic
for
human
use
.
Mevastatin
was
never
marketed
,
because
of
its
adverse
effects
of
tumors
,
muscle
deterioration
,
and
sometimes
death
in
laboratory
dogs
.
Every
major
company
selling
the
antipsychotics
—
Bristol
-
Myers
Squibb
,
Eli
Lilly
,
Pfizer
,
AstraZeneca
and
Johnson
&
Johnson
—
has
either
settled
recent
government
cases
,
under
the
False
Claims
Act
,
for
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
or
is
currently
under
investigation
for
possible
health
care
fraud
.
Following
charges
of
illegal
marketing
,
two
of
the
settlements
set
records
last
year
for
the
largest
criminal
fines
ever
imposed
on
corporations
.
One
involved
Eli
Lilly
's
antipsychotic
Zyprexa
,
and
the
other
involved
Bextra
.
In
the
Bextra
case
,
the
government
also
charged
Pfizer
with
illegally
marketing
another
antipsychotic
,
Geodon
;
Pfizer
settled
that
part
of
the
claim
for
$
301
million
,
without
admitting
any
wrongdoing
.
In
contrast
to
this
viewpoint
,
an
article
and
associated
editorial
in
the
New
England
Journal
of
Medicine
in
May
2015
emphasized
the
importance
of
pharmaceutical
industry
-
physician
interactions
for
the
development
of
novel
treatments
,
and
argued
that
moral
outrage
over
industry
malfeasance
had
unjustifiably
led
many
to
overemphasize
the
problems
created
by
financial
conflicts
of
interest
.
The
article
noted
that
major
healthcare
organizations
such
as
National
Center
for
Advancing
Translational
Sciences
of
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
,
the
President
’s
Council
of
Advisors
on
Science
and
Technology
,
the
World
Economic
Forum
,
the
Gates
Foundation
,
the
Wellcome
Trust
,
and
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
had
encouraged
greater
interactions
between
physicians
and
industry
in
order
to
bring
greater
benefits
to
patients
.
An
investigation
by
ProPublica
found
that
at
least
21
doctors
have
been
paid
more
than
$
500,000
for
speeches
and
consulting
by
drugs
manufacturers
since
2009
,
with
half
of
the
top
earners
working
in
psychiatry
,
and
about
$
2
billion
in
total
paid
to
doctors
for
such
services
.
AstraZeneca
,
Johnson
&
Johnson
and
Eli
Lilly
have
paid
billions
of
dollars
in
federal
settlements
over
allegations
that
they
paid
doctors
to
promote
drugs
for
unapproved
uses
.
Some
prominent
medical
schools
have
since
tightened
rules
on
faculty
acceptance
of
such
payments
by
drug
companies
.
Often
,
large
multinational
corporations
exhibit
vertical
integration
,
participating
in
a
broad
range
of
drug
discovery
and
development
,
manufacturing
and
quality
control
,
marketing
,
sales
,
and
distribution
.
Smaller
organizations
,
on
the
other
hand
,
often
focus
on
a
specific
aspect
such
as
discovering
drug
candidates
or
developing
formulations
.
Often
,
collaborative
agreements
between
research
organizations
and
large
pharmaceutical
companies
are
formed
to
explore
the
potential
of
new
drug
substances
.
More
recently
,
multi-nationals
are
increasingly
relying
on
contract
research
organizations
to
manage
drug
development
.
In
the
UK
,
the
Medicines
and
Healthcare
Products
Regulatory
Agency
approves
drugs
for
use
,
though
the
evaluation
is
done
by
the
European
Medicines
Agency
,
an
agency
of
the
European
Union
based
in
London
.
Normally
an
approval
in
the
UK
and
other
European
countries
comes
later
than
one
in
the
USA
.
Then
it
is
the
National
Institute
for
Health
and
Care
Excellence
(
NICE
)
,
for
England
and
Wales
,
who
decides
if
and
how
the
National
Health
Service
(
NHS
)
will
allow
(
in
the
sense
of
paying
for
)
their
use
.
The
British
National
Formulary
is
the
core
guide
for
pharmacists
and
clinicians
.
There
are
special
rules
for
certain
rare
diseases
(
"
orphan
diseases
"
)
in
several
major
drug
regulatory
territories
.
For
example
,
diseases
involving
fewer
than
200,000
patients
in
the
United
States
,
or
larger
populations
in
certain
circumstances
are
subject
to
the
Orphan
Drug
Act
.
Because
medical
research
and
development
of
drugs
to
treat
such
diseases
is
financially
disadvantageous
,
companies
that
do
so
are
rewarded
with
tax
reductions
,
fee
waivers
,
and
market
exclusivity
on
that
drug
for
a
limited
time
(
seven
years
)
,
regardless
of
whether
the
drug
is
protected
by
patents
.
Ben
Goldacre
has
argued
that
regulators
–
such
as
the
Medicines
and
Healthcare
products
Regulatory
Agency
(
MHRA
)
in
the
UK
,
or
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
(
FDA
)
in
the
United
States
–
advance
the
interests
of
the
drug
companies
rather
than
the
interests
of
the
public
due
to
revolving
door
exchange
of
employees
between
the
regulator
and
the
companies
and
friendships
develop
between
regulator
and
company
employees
.
He
argues
that
regulators
do
not
require
that
new
drugs
offer
an
improvement
over
what
is
already
available
,
or
even
that
they
be
particularly
effective
.
In
many
non
-US
western
countries
a
'
fourth
hurdle
'
of
cost
effectiveness
analysis
has
developed
before
new
technologies
can
be
provided
.
This
focuses
on
the
efficiency
(
in
terms
of
the
cost
per
QALY
)
of
the
technologies
in
question
rather
than
their
efficacy
.
In
England
and
Wales
NICE
decides
whether
and
in
what
circumstances
drugs
and
technologies
will
be
made
available
by
the
NHS
,
whilst
similar
arrangements
exist
with
the
Scottish
Medicines
Consortium
in
Scotland
,
and
the
Pharmaceutical
Benefits
Advisory
Committee
in
Australia
.
A
product
must
pass
the
threshold
for
cost-effectiveness
if
it
is
to
be
approved
.
Treatments
must
represent
'
value
for
money
'
and
a
net
benefit
to
society
.
The
top
ten
best-selling
drugs
of
2013
totaled
$
75.6
billion
in
sales
,
with
the
anti-inflammatory
drug
Humira
being
the
best-selling
drug
worldwide
at
$
10.7
billion
in
sales
.
The
second
and
third
best
selling
were
Enbrel
and
Remicade
,
respectively
.
The
top
three
best-selling
drugs
in
the
United
States
in
2013
were
Abilify
(
$
6.3
billion
,
)
Nexium
(
$
6
billion
)
and
Humira
(
$
5.4
billion
)
.
The
best-selling
drug
ever
,
Lipitor
,
averaged
$
13
billion
annually
and
netted
$
141
billion
total
over
its
lifetime
before
Pfizer
's
patent
expired
in
November
2011
.
Depending
on
a
number
of
considerations
,
a
company
may
apply
for
and
be
granted
a
patent
for
the
drug
,
or
the
process
of
producing
the
drug
,
granting
exclusivity
rights
typically
for
about
20
years
.
However
,
only
after
rigorous
study
and
testing
,
which
takes
10
to
15
years
on
average
,
will
governmental
authorities
grant
permission
for
the
company
to
market
and
sell
the
drug
.
Patent
protection
enables
the
owner
of
the
patent
to
recover
the
costs
of
research
and
development
through
high
profit
margins
for
the
branded
drug
.
When
the
patent
protection
for
the
drug
expires
,
a
generic
drug
is
usually
developed
and
sold
by
a
competing
company
.
The
development
and
approval
of
generics
is
less
expensive
,
allowing
them
to
be
sold
at
a
lower
price
.
Often
the
owner
of
the
branded
drug
will
introduce
a
generic
version
before
the
patent
expires
in
order
to
get
a
head
start
in
the
generic
market
.
Restructuring
has
therefore
become
routine
,
driven
by
the
patent
expiration
of
products
launched
during
the
industry
's
"
golden
era
"
in
the
1990s
and
companies
'
failure
to
develop
sufficient
new
blockbuster
products
to
replace
lost
revenues
.
In
the
United
States
,
new
pharmaceutical
products
must
be
approved
by
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
(
FDA
)
as
being
both
safe
and
effective
.
This
process
generally
involves
submission
of
an
Investigational
New
Drug
filing
with
sufficient
pre-clinical
data
to
support
proceeding
with
human
trials
.
Following
IND
approval
,
three
phases
of
progressively
larger
human
clinical
trials
may
be
conducted
.
Phase
I
generally
studies
toxicity
using
healthy
volunteers
.
Phase
II
can
include
pharmacokinetics
and
dosing
in
patients
,
and
Phase
III
is
a
very
large
study
of
efficacy
in
the
intended
patient
population
.
Following
the
successful
completion
of
phase
III
testing
,
a
New
Drug
Application
is
submitted
to
the
FDA
.
The
FDA
review
the
data
and
if
the
product
is
seen
as
having
a
positive
benefit-risk
assessment
,
approval
to
market
the
product
in
the
US
is
granted
.
Advertising
is
common
in
healthcare
journals
as
well
as
through
more
mainstream
media
routes
.
In
some
countries
,
notably
the
US
,
they
are
allowed
to
advertise
directly
to
the
general
public
.
Pharmaceutical
companies
generally
employ
sales
people
(
often
called
'
drug
reps
'
or
,
an
older
term
,
'
detail
men
'
)
to
market
directly
and
personally
to
physicians
and
other
healthcare
providers
.
In
some
countries
,
notably
the
US
,
pharmaceutical
companies
also
employ
lobbyists
to
influence
politicians
.
Marketing
of
prescription
drugs
in
the
US
is
regulated
by
the
federal
Prescription
Drug
Marketing
Act
of
1987
.
There
has
been
increasing
controversy
surrounding
pharmaceutical
marketing
and
influence
.
There
have
been
accusations
and
findings
of
influence
on
doctors
and
other
health
professionals
through
drug
reps
,
including
the
constant
provision
of
marketing
'
gifts
'
and
biased
information
to
health
professionals
;
highly
prevalent
advertising
in
journals
and
conferences
;
funding
independent
healthcare
organizations
and
health
promotion
campaigns
;
lobbying
physicians
and
politicians
(
more
than
any
other
industry
in
the
US
)
;
sponsorship
of
medical
schools
or
nurse
training
;
sponsorship
of
continuing
educational
events
,
with
influence
on
the
curriculum
;
and
hiring
physicians
as
paid
consultants
on
medical
advisory
boards
.
Asphalt
/
bitumen
also
occurs
in
unconsolidated
sandstones
known
as
"
oil
sands
"
in
Alberta
,
Canada
,
and
the
similar
"
tar
sands
"
in
Utah
,
US
.
The
Canadian
province
of
Alberta
has
most
of
the
world
's
reserves
of
natural
bitumen
,
in
three
huge
deposits
covering
142,000
square
kilometres
(
55,000
sq
mi
)
,
an
area
larger
than
England
or
New
York
state
.
These
bituminous
sands
contain
166
billion
barrels
(
26.4×
10
^9
m
3
)
of
commercially
established
oil
reserves
,
giving
Canada
the
third
largest
oil
reserves
in
the
world
.
and
produce
over
2.3
million
barrels
per
day
(
370
×
10
^3
m
3/d
)
of
heavy
crude
oil
and
synthetic
crude
oil
.
Although
historically
it
was
used
without
refining
to
pave
roads
,
nearly
all
of
the
bitumen
is
now
used
as
raw
material
for
oil
refineries
in
Canada
and
the
United
States
.
The
first
use
of
asphalt
/
bitumen
in
the
New
World
was
by
indigenous
peoples
.
On
the
west
coast
,
as
early
as
the
13th
century
,
the
Tongva
,
Luiseño
and
Chumash
peoples
collected
the
naturally
occurring
asphalt
/
bitumen
that
seeped
to
the
surface
above
underlying
petroleum
deposits
.
All
three
used
the
substance
as
an
adhesive
.
It
is
found
on
many
different
artifacts
of
tools
and
ceremonial
items
.
For
example
,
it
was
used
on
rattles
to
adhere
gourds
or
turtle
shells
to
rattle
handles
.
It
was
also
used
in
decorations
.
Small
round
shell
beads
were
often
set
in
asphaltum
to
provide
decorations
.
It
was
used
as
a
sealant
on
baskets
to
make
them
watertight
for
carrying
water
.
Asphaltum
was
used
also
to
seal
the
planks
on
ocean-going
canoes
.
When
maintenance
is
performed
on
asphalt
pavements
,
such
as
milling
to
remove
a
worn
or
damaged
surface
,
the
removed
material
can
be
returned
to
a
facility
for
processing
into
new
pavement
mixtures
.
The
asphalt
/
bitumen
in
the
removed
material
can
be
reactivated
and
put
back
to
use
in
new
pavement
mixes
.
With
some
95
%
of
paved
roads
being
constructed
of
or
surfaced
with
asphalt
,
a
substantial
amount
of
asphalt
pavement
material
is
reclaimed
each
year
.
According
to
industry
surveys
conducted
annually
by
the
Federal
Highway
Administration
and
the
National
Asphalt
Pavement
Association
,
more
than
99
%
of
the
asphalt
removed
each
year
from
road
surfaces
during
widening
and
resurfacing
projects
is
reused
as
part
of
new
pavements
,
roadbeds
,
shoulders
and
embankments
.
In
Alberta
,
five
bitumen
upgraders
produce
synthetic
crude
oil
and
a
variety
of
other
products
:
The
Suncor
Energy
upgrader
near
Fort
McMurray
,
Alberta
produces
synthetic
crude
oil
plus
diesel
fuel
;
the
Syncrude
Canada
,
Canadian
Natural
Resources
,
and
Nexen
upgraders
near
Fort
McMurray
produce
synthetic
crude
oil
;
and
the
Shell
Scotford
Upgrader
near
Edmonton
produces
synthetic
crude
oil
plus
an
intermediate
feedstock
for
the
nearby
Shell
Oil
Refinery
.
A
sixth
upgrader
,
under
construction
in
2015
near
Redwater
,
Alberta
,
will
upgrade
half
of
its
crude
bitumen
directly
to
diesel
fuel
,
with
the
remainder
of
the
output
being
sold
as
feedstock
to
nearby
oil
refineries
and
petrochemical
plants
.
Asphalt
/
bitumen
is
typically
stored
and
transported
at
temperatures
around
150
°C
(
302
°F
)
.
Sometimes
diesel
oil
or
kerosene
are
mixed
in
before
shipping
to
retain
liquidity
;
upon
delivery
,
these
lighter
materials
are
separated
out
of
the
mixture
.
This
mixture
is
often
called
"
bitumen
feedstock
"
,
or
BFS
.
Some
dump
trucks
route
the
hot
engine
exhaust
through
pipes
in
the
dump
body
to
keep
the
material
warm
.
The
backs
of
tippers
carrying
asphalt
/
bitumen
,
as
well
as
some
handling
equipment
,
are
also
commonly
sprayed
with
a
releasing
agent
before
filling

Diesel

is
no

The
Albanian
bitumen
extraction
has
a
long
history
and
was
practiced
in
an
organized
way
by
the
Romans
.
After
centuries
of
silence
,
the
first
mentions
of
Albanian
bitumen
appeared
only
in
1868
,
when
the
Frenchman
Coquand
published
the
first
geological
description
of
the
deposits
of
Albanian
bitumen
.
In
1875
,
the
exploitation
rights
were
granted
to
the
Ottoman
government
and
in
1912
,
they
were
transferred
to
the
Italian
company
Simsa
.
Since
1945
,
the
mine
was
exploited
by
the
Albanian
government
and
from
2001
to
date
,
the
management
passed
to
a
French
company
,
which
organized
the
mining
process
for
the
manufacture
of
the
natural
bitumen
on
an
industrial
scale
.
The
word
asphalt
is
derived
from
the
late
Middle
English
,
in
turn
from
French
asphalte
,
based
on
Late
Latin
asphalton
,
asphaltum
,
which
is
the
latinisation
of
the
Greek
ἄσφαλτος
(
ásphaltos
,
ásphalton
)
,
a
word
meaning
"
asphalt
/
bitumen
/
pitch
"
,
which
perhaps
derives
from
ἀ-
,
"
without
"
and
σφάλλω
(
sfallō
)
,
"
make
fall
"
.
Note
that
in
French
,
the
term
asphalte
is
used
for
naturally
occurring
bitumen-soaked
limestone
deposits
,
and
for
specialised
manufactured
products
with
fewer
voids
or
greater
bitumen
content
than
the
"
asphaltic
concrete
"
used
to
pave
roads
.
It
is
a
significant
fact
that
the
first
use
of
asphalt
by
the
ancients
was
in
the
nature
of
a
cement
for
securing
or
joining
together
various
objects
,
and
it
thus
seems
likely
that
the
name
itself
was
expressive
of
this
application
.
Specifically
Herodotus
mentioned
that
bitumen
was
brought
to
Babylon
to
build
its
gigantic
fortification
wall
.
From
the
Greek
,
the
word
passed
into
late
Latin
,
and
thence
into
French
(
asphalte
)
and
English
(
"
asphaltum
"
and
"
asphalt
"
)
.
The
terms
asphalt
and
bitumen
are
often
used
interchangeably
to
mean
both
natural
and
manufactured
forms
of
the
substance
.
In
American
English
,
asphalt
(
or
asphalt
cement
)
is
the
carefully
refined
residue
from
the
distillation
process
of
selected
crude
oils
.
Outside
the
United
States
,
the
product
is
often
called
bitumen
.
Geologists
often
prefer
the
term
bitumen
.
Common
usage
often
refers
to
various
forms
of
asphalt
/
bitumen
as
"
tar
"
,
such
as
at
the
La
Brea
Tar
Pits
.
Another
archaic
term
for
asphalt
/
bitumen
is
"
pitch
"
.
The
great
majority
of
asphalt
used
commercially
is
obtained
from
petroleum
.
Nonetheless
,
large
amounts
of
asphalt
occur
in
concentrated
form
in
nature
.
Naturally
occurring
deposits
of
asphalt
/
bitumen
are
formed
from
the
remains
of
ancient
,
microscopic
algae
(
diatoms
)
and
other
once-living
things
.
These
remains
were
deposited
in
the
mud
on
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
or
lake
where
the
organisms
lived
.
Under
the
heat
(
above
50
°C
)
and
pressure
of
burial
deep
in
the
earth
,
the
remains
were
transformed
into
materials
such
as
asphalt
/
bitumen
,
kerogen
,
or
petroleum
.
The
world
's
largest
deposit
of
natural
bitumen
,
known
as
the
Athabasca
oil
sands
is
located
in
the
McMurray
Formation
of
Northern
Alberta
.
This
formation
is
from
the
early
Cretaceous
,
and
is
composed
of
numerous
lenses
of
oil-
bearing
sand
with
up
to
20
%
oil
.
Isotopic
studies
attribute
the
oil
deposits
to
be
about
110
million
years
old
.
Two
smaller
but
still
very
large
formations
occur
in
the
Peace
River
oil
sands
and
the
Cold
Lake
oil
sands
,
to
the
west
and
southeast
of
the
Athabasca
oil
sands
,
respectively
.
Of
the
Alberta
bitumen
deposits
,
only
parts
of
the
Athabasca
oil
sands
are
shallow
enough
to
be
suitable
for
surface
mining
.
The
other
80
%
has
to
be
produced
by
oil
wells
using
enhanced
oil
recovery
techniques
like
steam-assisted
gravity
drainage
.
Bitumen
was
used
in
early
photographic
technology
.
In
1826
or
1827
,
it
was
used
by
French
scientist
Joseph
Nicéphore
Niépce
to
make
the
oldest
surviving
photograph
from
nature
.
The
bitumen
was
thinly
coated
onto
a
pewter
plate
which
was
then
exposed
in
a
camera
.
Exposure
to
light
hardened
the
bitumen
and
made
it
insoluble
,
so
that
when
it
was
subsequently
rinsed
with
a
solvent
only
the
sufficiently
light
-struck
areas
remained
.
Many
hours
of
exposure
in
the
camera
were
required
,
making
bitumen
impractical
for
ordinary
photography
,
but
from
the
1850s
to
the
1920s
it
was
in
common
use
as
a
photoresist
in
the
production
of
printing
plates
for
various
photomechanical
printing
processes
.

The
first
British
patent
for
the
use
of
asphalt
/
bitumen
was
'
Cassell
's
patent
asphalte
or
bitumen
'
in
1834
.
Then
on
25
November
1837
,
Richard
Tappin
Claridge
patented
the
use
of
Seyssel
asphalt
(
patent
#
7849
)
,
for
use
in
asphalte
pavement
,
having
seen
it
employed
in
France
and
Belgium
when
visiting
with
Frederick
Walter
Simms
,
who
worked
with
him
on
the
introduction
of
asphalt
to
Britain
.
Dr
T.
Lamb
Phipson
writes
that
his
father
,
Samuel
Ryland
Phipson
,
a
friend
of
Claridge
,
was
also
"
instrumental
in
introducing
the
asphalte
pavement
(
in
1836
)
"
.
Indeed
,
mastic
pavements
had
been
previously
employed
at
Vauxhall
by
a
competitor
of
Claridge
,
but
without
success
.
Roads
in
the
US
have
been
paved
with
materials
that
include
asphalt
/
bitumen
since
at
least
1870
,
when
a
street
in
front
of
the
Newark
,
NJ
City
Hall
was
paved
.
In
many
cases
,
these
early
pavings
were
made
from
naturally
occurring
"
bituminous
rock
"
,
such
as
at
Ritchie
Mines
in
Macfarlan
in
Ritchie
County
,
West
Virginia
from
1852
to
1873
.
In
1876
,
asphalt
-
based
paving
was
used
to
pave
Pennsylvania
Avenue
in
Washington
,
DC
,
in
time
for
the
celebration
of
the
national
centennial
.
Asphalt
/
bitumen
was
also
used
for
flooring
,
paving
and
waterproofing
of
baths
and
swimming
pools
during
the
early
20th
century
,
following
similar
trends
in
Europe
.
In
1838
,
there
was
a
flurry
of
entrepreneurial
activity
involving
asphalt
/
bitumen
,
which
had
uses
beyond
paving
.
For
example
,
asphalt
could
also
used
for
flooring
,
damp
proofing
in
buildings
,
and
for
waterproofing
of
various
types
of
pools
and
baths
,
with
these
latter
themselves
proliferating
in
the
19th
century
.
On
the
London
stockmarket
,
there
were
various
claims
as
to
the
exclusivity
of
asphalt
quality
from
France
,
Germany
and
England
.
And
numerous
patents
were
granted
in
France
,
with
similar
numbers
of
patent
applications
being
denied
in
England
due
to
their
similarity
to
each
other
.
In
England
,
"
Claridge
's
was
the
type
most
used
in
the
1840s
and
50
s
"
The
value
of
the
deposit
was
obvious
from
the
start
,
but
the
means
of
extracting
the
bitumen
were
not
.
The
nearest
town
,
Fort
McMurray
,
Alberta
was
a
small
fur
trading
post
,
other
markets
were
far
away
,
and
transportation
costs
were
too
high
to
ship
the
raw
bituminous
sand
for
paving
.
In
1915
,
Sidney
Ells
of
the
Federal
Mines
Branch
experimented
with
separation
techniques
and
used
the
bitumen
to
pave
600
feet
of
road
in
Edmonton
,
Alberta
.
Other
roads
in
Alberta
were
paved
with
oil
sands
,
but
it
was
generally
not
economic
.
During
the
1920s
Dr.
Karl
A.
Clark
of
the
Alberta
Research
Council
patented
a
hot
water
oil
separation
process
and
entrepreneur
Robert
C.
Fitzsimmons
built
the
Bitumount
oil
separation
plant
,
which
between
1925
and
1958
produced
up
to
300
barrels
(
50
m3
)
per
day
of
bitumen
using
Dr.
Clark
's
method
.
Most
of
the
bitumen
was
used
for
waterproofing
roofs
,
but
other
uses
included
fuels
,
lubrication
oils
,
printers
ink
,
medicines
,
rust
and
acid-proof
paints
,
fireproof
roofing
,
street
paving
,
patent
leather
,
and
fence
post
preservatives
.
Eventually
Fitzsimmons
ran
out
of
money
and
the
plant
was
taken
over
by
the
Alberta
government
.
Today
the
Bitumount
plant
is
a
Provincial
Historic
Site
.
Canadian
bitumen
does
not
differ
substantially
from
oils
such
as
Venezuelan
extra-heavy
and
Mexican
heavy
oil
in
chemical
composition
,
and
the
real
difficulty
is
moving
the
extremely
viscous
bitumen
through
oil
pipelines
to
the
refinery
.
Many
modern
oil
refineries
are
extremely
sophisticated
and
can
process
non-upgraded
bitumen
directly
into
products
such
as
gasoline
,
diesel
fuel
,
and
refined
asphalt
without
any
preprocessing
.
This
is
particularly
common
in
areas
such
as
the
US
Gulf
coast
,
where
refineries
were
designed
to
process
Venezuelan
and
Mexican
oil
,
and
in
areas
such
as
the
US
Midwest
where
refineries
were
rebuilt
to
process
heavy
oil
as
domestic
light
oil
production
declined
.
Given
the
choice
,
such
heavy
oil
refineries
usually
prefer
to
buy
bitumen
rather
than
synthetic
oil
because
the
cost
is
lower
,
and
in
some
cases
because
they
prefer
to
produce
more
diesel
fuel
and
less
gasoline
.
By
2015
Canadian
production
and
exports
of
non-upgraded
bitumen
exceeded
that
of
synthetic
crude
oil
at
over
1.3
million
barrels
(
210
×
10
^3
m
3
)
per
day
,
of
which
about
65
%
was
exported
to
the
United
States
.
A
number
of
technologies
allow
asphalt
/
bitumen
to
be
mixed
at
much
lower
temperatures
.
These
involve
mixing
with
petroleum
solvents
to
form
"
cutbacks
"
with
reduced
melting
point
,
or
mixtures
with
water
to
turn
the
asphalt
/
bitumen
into
an
emulsion
.
Asphalt
emulsions
contain
up
to
70
%
asphalt
/
bitumen
and
typically
less
than
1.5
%
chemical
additives
.
There
are
two
main
types
of
emulsions
with
different
affinity
for
aggregates
,
cationic
and
anionic
.
Asphalt
emulsions
are
used
in
a
wide
variety
of
applications
.
Chipseal
involves
spraying
the
road
surface
with
asphalt
emulsion
followed
by
a
layer
of
crushed
rock
,
gravel
or
crushed
slag
.
Slurry
seal
involves
the
creation
of
a
mixture
of
asphalt
emulsion
and
fine
crushed
aggregate
that
is
spread
on
the
surface
of
a
road
.
Cold-mixed
asphalt
can
also
be
made
from
asphalt
emulsion
to
create
pavements
similar
to
hot-mixed
asphalt
,
several
inches
in
depth
and
asphalt
emulsions
are
also
blended
into
recycled
hot
-mix
asphalt
to
create
low-cost
pavements
.
Naturally
occurring
crude
asphalt
/
bitumen
impregnated
in
sedimentary
rock
is
the
prime
feed
stock
for
petroleum
production
from
"
Oil
sands
"
,
currently
under
development
in
Alberta
,
Canada
.
Canada
has
most
of
the
world
's
supply
of
natural
asphalt
/
bitumen
,
covering
140,000
square
kilometres
(
an
area
larger
than
England
)
,
giving
it
the
second-largest
proven
oil
reserves
in
the
world
.
The
Athabasca
oil
sands
is
the
largest
asphalt
/
bitumen
deposit
in
Canada
and
the
only
one
accessible
to
surface
mining
,
although
recent
technological
breakthroughs
have
resulted
in
deeper
deposits
becoming
producible
by
in
situ
methods
.
Because
of
oil
price
increases
after
2003
,
producing
bitumen
became
highly
profitable
,
but
as
a
result
of
the
decline
after
2014
it
became
uneconomic
to
build
new
plants
again
.
By
2014
,
Canadian
crude
asphalt
/
bitumen
production
averaged
about
2.3
million
barrels
(
370,000
m
3
)
per
day
and
was
projected
to
rise
to
4.4
million
barrels
(
700,000
m
3
)
per
day
by
2020
.
The
total
amount
of
crude
asphalt
/
bitumen
in
Alberta
which
could
be
extracted
is
estimated
to
be
about
310
billion
barrels
(
50
×
10
^9
m

)
,
which
at
a
rate
of
4,400,000
barrels
per
day
(
700,000
m
3/d
)
would
last
about
200
years
.
Roofing
shingles
account
for
most
of
the
remaining
asphalt
/
bitumen
consumption
.
Other
uses
include
cattle
sprays
,
fence
-
post
treatments
,
and
waterproofing
for
fabrics
.
Asphalt
/
bitumen
is
used
to
make
Japan
black
,
a
lacquer
known
especially
for
its
use
on
iron
and
steel
,
and
it
is
also
used
in
paint
and
marker
inks
by
some
graffiti
supply
companies
to
increase
the
weather
resistance
and
permanence
of
the
paint
or
ink
,
and
to
make
the
color
much
darker
.

Asphalt
/
bitumen
is
also
used
to
seal
some
alkaline
batteries
during
the
manufacturing
process
.
The
expression
"
bitumen
"
originated
in
the
Sanskrit
,
where
we
find
the
words
jatu
,
meaning
"
pitch
,
"
and
jatu-
krit
,
meaning
"
pitch
creating
"
,
"
pitch
producing
"
(
referring
to
coniferous
or
resinous
trees
)
.
The
Latin
equivalent
is
claimed
by
some
to
be
originally
gwitu-men
(
pertaining
to
pitch
)
,
and
by
others
,
pixtumens
(
exuding
or
bubbling
pitch
)
,
which
was
subsequently
shortened
to
bitumen
,
thence
passing
via
French
into
English
.
From
the
same
root
is
derived
the
Anglo
Saxon
word
cwidu
(
mastix
)
,
the
German
word
Kitt
(
cement
or
mastic
)
and
the
old
Norse
word
kvada
.
Asphalt
/
bitumen
can
sometimes
be
confused
with
"
coal
tar
"
,
which
is
a
visually
similar
black
,
thermoplastic
material
produced
by
the
destructive
distillation
of
coal
.
During
the
early
and
mid-20th
century
when
town
gas
was
produced
,
coal
tar
was
a
readily
available
byproduct
and
extensively
used
as
the
binder
for
road
aggregates
.
The
addition
of
tar
to
macadam
roads
led
to
the
word
tarmac
,
which
is
now
used
in
common
parlance
to
refer
to
road-making
materials
.
However
,
since
the
1970s
,
when
natural
gas
succeeded
town
gas
,
asphalt
/
bitumen
has
completely
overtaken
the
use
of
coal
tar
in
these
applications
.
Other
examples
of
this
confusion
include
the
La
Brea
Tar
Pits
and
the
Canadian
oil
sands
,
both
of
which
actually
contain
natural
bitumen
rather
than
tar
.
Pitch
is
another
term
sometimes
used
at
times
to
refer
to
asphalt
/
bitumen
,
as
in
Pitch
Lake
.
One
hundred
years
after
the
fall
of
Constantinople
in
1453
,
Pierre
Belon
described
in
his
work
Observations
in
1553
that
pissasphalto
,
a
mixture
of
pitch
and
bitumen
,
was
used
in
Dubrovnik
for
tarring
of
ships
from
where
it
was
exported
to
a
market
place
in
Venice
where
it
could
be
bought
by
anyone
.
An
1838
edition
of
Mechanics
Magazine
cites
an
early
use
of
asphalt
in
France
.
A
pamphlet
dated
1621
,
by
"
a
certain
Monsieur
d'Eyrinys
,
states
that
he
had
discovered
the
existence
(
of
asphaltum
)
in
large
quantities
in
the
vicinity
of
Neufchatel
"
,
and
that
he
proposed
to
use
it
in
a
variety
of
ways
–
"
principally
in
the
construction
of
air-proof
granaries
,
and
in
protecting
,
by
means
of
the
arches
,
the
water
-
courses
in
the
city
of
Paris
from
the
intrusion
of
dirt
and
filth
"
,
which
at
that
time
made
the
water
unusable
.
"
He
expatiates
also
on
the
excellence
of
this
material
for
forming
level
and
durable
terraces
"
in

streets
not
one

of

generation

.
But
it
was
generally
neglected
in
France
until
the
revolution
of
1830
.
Then
,
in
the
1830s
,
there
was
a
surge
of
interest
,
and
asphalt
became
widely
used
"
for
pavements
,
flat
roofs
,
and
the
lining
of
cisterns
,
and
in
England
,
some
use
of
it
had
been
made
of
it
for
similar
purposes
"
.
Its
rise
in
Europe
was
"
a
sudden
phenomenon
"
,
after
natural
deposits
were
found
"
in
France
at
Osbann
(
BasRhin
)
,
the
Parc
(
l'
Ain
)
and
the
Puy-de-la-Poix
(
Puy-de-Dome
)
"
,
although
it
could
also
be
made
artificially
.
One
of
the
earliest
uses
in
France
was
the
laying
of
about
24,000
square
yards
of
Seyssel
asphalt
at
the
Place
de
la
Concorde
in
1835
.
In
1838
,
Claridge
obtained
patents
in
Scotland
on
27
March
,
and
Ireland
on
23
April
,
and
in
1851
extensions
were
sought
for
all
three
patents
,
by
the
trustees
of
a
company
previously
formed
by
Claridge
.
This
was
Claridge
's
Patent
Asphalte
Company
,
formed
in
1838
for
the
purpose
of
introducing
to
Britain
"
Asphalte
in
its
natural
state
from
the
mine
at
Pyrimont
Seysell
in
France
"
,
and
"
laid
one
of
the
first

Trials
were
made
of
the
pavement
in
1838
on

footway
in

Canada
has
the
world
's
largest
deposit
of
natural
bitumen
in
the
Athabasca
oil
sands
and
Canadian
First
Nations
along
the
Athabasca
River
had
long
used
it
to
waterproof
their
canoes
.
In
1719
,
a
Cree
Indian
named
Wa-Pa-
Su
brought
a
sample
for
trade
to
Henry
Kelsey
of
the
Hudson
’s
Bay
Company
,
who
was
the
first
recorded
European
to
see
it
.
However
,
it
was
n't
until
1787
that
fur
trader
and
explorer
Alexander
MacKenzie
saw
the
Athabasca
oil
sands
and
said
,
"
At
about
24
miles
from
the
fork
(
of
the
Athabasca
and
Clearwater
Rivers
)
are
some
bituminous
fountains
into
which
a
pole
of
20
feet
long
may
be
inserted
without
the
least
resistance
.
"
Mastic
asphalt
is
a
type
of
asphalt
which
differs
from
dense
graded
asphalt
(
asphalt
concrete
)
in
that
it
has
a
higher
asphalt
/
bitumen
(
binder
)
content
,
usually
around
7–
10
%
of
the
whole
aggregate
mix
,
as
opposed
to
rolled
asphalt
concrete
,
which
has
only
around
5
%
added
asphalt
/
bitumen
.
This
thermoplastic
substance
is
widely
used
in
the
building
industry
for
waterproofing
flat
roofs
and
tanking
underground
.
Mastic
asphalt
is
heated
to
a
temperature
of
210
°C
(
410
°F
)
and
is
spread
in
layers
to
form
an
impervious
barrier
about
20
millimeters
(
0.79
inches
)
thick
.
Because
of
the
difficulty
of
moving
crude
bitumen
through
pipelines
,
non-upgraded
bitumen
is
usually
diluted
with
natural
-
gas
condensate
in
a
form
called
dilbit
or
with
synthetic
crude
oil
,
called
synbit
.
However
,
to
meet
international
competition
,
much
non-upgraded
bitumen
is
now
sold
as
a
blend
of
multiple
grades
of
bitumen
,
conventional
crude
oil
,
synthetic
crude
oil
,
and
condensate
in
a
standardized
benchmark
product
such
as
Western
Canadian
Select
.
This
sour
,
heavy
crude
oil
blend
is
designed
to
have
uniform
refining
characteristics
to
compete
with
internationally
marketed
heavy
oils
such
as
Mexican
Mayan
or
Arabian
Dubai
Crude
.
Asphalt
/
bitumen
is
similar
to
the
organic
matter
in
carbonaceous
meteorites
.
However
,
detailed
studies
have
shown
these
materials
to
be
distinct
.
The
vast
Alberta
bitumen
resources
are
believed
to
have
started
out
as
living
material
from
marine
plants
and
animals
,
mainly
algae
,
that
died
millions
of
years
ago
when
an
ancient
ocean
covered
Alberta
.
They
were
covered
by
mud
,
buried
deeply
over
the
eons
,
and
gently
cooked
into
oil
by
geothermal
heat
at
a
temperature
of
50
to
150
°C
(
120
to
300
°
F
)
.
Due
to
pressure
from
the
rising
of
the
Rocky
Mountains
in
southwestern
Alberta
,
80
to
55
million
years
ago
,
the
oil
was
driven
northeast
hundreds
of
kilometres
into
underground
sand
deposits
left
behind
by
ancient
river
beds
and
ocean
beaches
,
thus
forming
the
oil
sands
.
Selenizza
is
mainly
used
as
an
additive
in
the
road
construction
sector
.
It
is
mixed
with
traditional
bitumen
to
improve
both
the
viscoelastic
properties
and
the
resistance
to
ageing
.
It
may
be
blended
with
the
hot
bitumen
in
tanks
,
but
its
granular
form
allows
it
to
be
fed
in
the
mixer
or
in
the
recycling
ring
of
normal
asphalt
plants
.
Other
typical
applications
include
the
production
of
mastic
asphalts
for
sidewalks
,
bridges
,
car-parks
and
urban
roads
as
well
as
drilling
fluid
additives
for
the
oil
and
gas
industry
.
Selenizza
is
available
in
powder
or
in
granular
material
of
various
particle
sizes
and
is
packaged
in
big
bags
or
in
thermal
fusible
polyethylene
bags
.
In
British
English
,
the
word
'
asphalt
'
is
used
to
refer
to
a
mixture
of
mineral
aggregate
and
asphalt
/
bitumen
(
also
called
tarmac
in
common
parlance
)
.
When
bitumen
is
mixed
with
clay
it
is
usually
called
asphaltum
.
The
earlier
word
'
asphaltum
'
is
now
archaic
and
not
commonly
used
.

In
American
English
,
'
asphalt
'
is
equivalent
to
the
British
'
bitumen
'
.
However
,
'
asphalt
'
is
also
commonly
used
as
a
shortened
form
of
'
asphalt

(
therefore
equivalent
to
the
British

In
Australian
English
,
bitumen
is
often
used
as
the
generic
term
for
road
surfaces
.
In
Canadian
English
,
the
word
bitumen
is
used
to
refer
to
the
vast
Canadian
deposits
of
extremely
heavy
crude
oil
,
while
asphalt
is
used
for
the
oil
refinery
product
used
to
pave
roads
and
manufacture
roof
shingles
and
various
waterproofing
products
.
Diluted
bitumen
(
diluted
with
naphtha
to
make
it
flow
in
pipelines
)
is
known
as
dilbit
in
the
Canadian
petroleum
industry
,
while
bitumen
"
upgraded
"
to
synthetic
crude
oil
is
known
as
syncrude
and
syncrude
blended
with
bitumen
as
synbit
.
Bitumen
is
still
the
preferred
geological
term
for
naturally
occurring
deposits
of
the
solid
or
semi-solid
form
of
petroleum
.
Bituminous
rock
is
a
form
of
sandstone
impregnated
with
bitumen
.
The
tar
sands
of
Alberta
,
Canada
are
a
similar
material
.
Bitumen
was
the
nemesis
of
many
artists
during
the
19th
century
.
Although
widely
used
for
a
time
,
it
ultimately
proved
unstable
for
use
in
oil
painting
,
especially
when
mixed
with
the
most
common
diluents
,
such
as
linseed
oil
,
varnish
and
turpentine
.
Unless
thoroughly
diluted
,
bitumen
never
fully
solidifies
and
will
in
time
corrupt
the
other
pigments
with
which
it
comes
into
contact
.
The
use
of
bitumen
as
a
glaze
to
set
in
shadow
or
mixed
with
other
colors
to
render
a
darker
tone
resulted
in
the
eventual
deterioration
of
many
paintings
,
for
instance
those
of
Delacroix
.
Perhaps
the
most
famous
example
of
the
destructiveness
of
bitumen
is
Théodore
Géricault
's
Raft
of
the
Medusa
(
1818
–
1819
)
,
where
his
use
of
bitumen
caused
the
brilliant
colors
to
degenerate
into
dark
greens
and
blacks
and
the
paint
and
canvas
to
buckle
.
In
1914
,
Claridge
's
Company
entered
into
a
joint
venture
to
produce
tar-bound
macadam
,
with
materials
manufactured
through
a
subsidiary
company
called
Clarmac
Roads
Ltd
.
Two
products
resulted
,
namely
Clarmac
,
and
Clarphalte
,
with
the
former
being
manufactured
by
Clarmac
Roads
and
the
latter
by
Claridge
's
Patent
Asphalte
Co.
,
although
Clarmac
was
more
widely
used
.
[
note

]
However
,
the
First
World
War
impacted
financially
on
the
Clarmac
Company
,
which
entered
into
liquidation
in
1915
.
The
failure
of
Clarmac
Roads
Ltd
had
a
flow
-on
effect
to
Claridge
's
Company
,
which
was
itself
compulsorily
wound
up
,
ceasing
operations
in
1917
,
having
invested
a
substantial
amount
of
funds
into
the
new
venture
,
both
at
the
outset
,
and
in
a
subsequent
attempt
to
save
the
Clarmac
Company
.
The
largest
use
of
asphalt
/
bitumen
is
for
making
asphalt
concrete
for
road
surfaces
and
accounts
for
approximately
85
%
of
the
asphalt
consumed
in
the
United
States
.
Asphalt
concrete
pavement
mixes
are
typically
composed
of
5
%
asphalt
/
bitumen
cement
and
95
%
aggregates
(
stone
,
sand
,
and
gravel
)
.
Due
to
its
highly
viscous
nature
,
asphalt
/
bitumen
cement
must
be
heated
so
it
can
be
mixed
with
the
aggregates
at
the
asphalt
mixing
facility
.
The
temperature
required
varies
depending
upon
characteristics
of
the
asphalt
/
bitumen
and
the
aggregates
,
but
warm
-
mix
asphalt
technologies
allow
producers
to
reduce
the
temperature
required
.
There
are
about
4,000
asphalt
concrete
mixing
plants
in
the
U.S.
,
and
a
similar
number
in
Europe
.
Synthetic
crude
oil
,
also
known
as
syncrude
,
is
the
output
from
a
bitumen
upgrader
facility
used
in
connection
with
oil
sand
production
in
Canada
.
Bituminous
sands
are
mined
using
enormous
(
100
ton
capacity
)
power
shovels
and
loaded
into
even
larger
(
400
ton
capacity
)
dump
trucks
for
movement
to
an
upgrading
facility
.
The
process
used
to
extract
the
bitumen
from
the
sand
is
a
hot
water
process
originally
developed
by
Dr.
Karl
Clark
of
the
University
of
Alberta
during
the
1920s
.
After
extraction
from
the
sand
,
the
bitumen
is
fed
into
a
bitumen
upgrader
which
converts
it
into
a
light
crude
oil
equivalent
.
This
synthetic
substance
is
fluid
enough
to
be
transferred
through
conventional
oil
pipelines
and
can
be
fed
into
conventional
oil
refineries
without
any
further
treatment
.
By
2015
Canadian
bitumen
upgraders
were
producing
over
1
million
barrels
(
160
×
10
^3
m
3
)
per
day
of
synthetic
crude
oil
,
of
which
75
%
was
exported
to
oil
refineries
in
the
United
States
.
About
40,000,000
tons
were
produced
in
1984
[

.
It
is
obtained
as
the
"
heavy
"
(
i.e.
,
difficult
to
distill
)
fraction
.
Material
with
a
boiling
point
greater
than
around
500
°C
is
considered
asphalt
.
Vacuum
distillation
separates
it
from
the
other
components
in
crude
oil
(
such
as
naphtha
,
gasoline
and
diesel
)
.
The
resulting
material
is
typically
further
treated
to
extract
small
but
valuable
amounts
of
lubricants
and
to
adjust
the
properties
of
the
material
to
suit
applications
.
In
a
de-asphalting
unit
,
the
crude
asphalt
is
treated
with
either
propane
or
butane
in
a
supercritical
phase
to
extract
the
lighter
molecules
,
which
are
then
separated
.
Further
processing
is
possible
by
"
blowing
"
the
product
:
namely
reacting
it
with
oxygen
.
This
step
makes
the
product
harder
and
more
viscous
.
Selenizza
is
a
naturally
occurring
solid
hydrocarbon
bitumen
found
in
the
native
asphalt
deposit
of
Selenice
,
in
Albania
,
the
only
European
asphalt
mine
still
in
use
.
The
rock
asphalt
is
found
in
the
form
of
veins
,
filling
cracks
in
a
more
or
less
horizontal
direction
.
The
bitumen
content
varies
from
83
%
to
92
%
(
soluble
in
carbon
disulphide
)
,
with
a
penetration
value
near
to
zero
and
a
softening
point
(
ring
&
ball
)
around
120
°C
.
The
insoluble
matter
,
consisting
mainly
of
silica
ore
,
ranges
from
8
%
to
17
%
.
People
can
be
exposed
to
asphalt
in
the
workplace
by
breathing
in
fumes
or
skin
absorption
.
The
National
Institute
for
Occupational
Safety
and
Health
(
NIOSH
)
has
set
a
Recommended
exposure
limit
(
REL
)
of
5
mg
/
m3
over
a
15
-
minute
period
.
Asphalt
is
basically
an
inert
material
that
must
be
heated
or
diluted
to
a
point
where
it
becomes
workable
for
the
production
of
materials
for
paving
,
roofing
,
and
other
applications
.
In
examining
the
potential
health
hazards
associated
with
asphalt
,
the
International
Agency
for
Research
on
Cancer
(
IARC
)
determined
that
it
is
the
application
parameters
,
predominantly
temperature
,
that
effect
occupational
exposure
and
the
potential
bioavailable
carcinogenic
hazard
/
risk
of
the
asphalt
emissions
.
In
particular
,
temperatures
greater
than
199
°C
(
390
°F
)
,
were
shown
to
produce
a
greater
exposure
risk
than
when
asphalt
was
heated
to
lower
temperatures
,
such
as
those
typically
used
in
asphalt
pavement
mix
production
and
placement
.
Physically
,
clothing
serves
many
purposes
:
it
can
serve
as
protection
from
the
elements
,
and
can
enhance
safety
during
hazardous
activities
such
as
hiking
and
cooking
.
It
protects
the
wearer
from
rough
surfaces
,
rash
-
causing
plants
,
insect
bites
,
splinters
,
thorns
and
prickles
by
providing
a
barrier
between
the
skin
and
the
environment
.
Clothes
can
insulate
against
cold
or
hot
conditions
.
Further
,
they
can
provide
a
hygienic
barrier
,
keeping
infectious
and
toxic
materials
away
from
the
body
.
Clothing
also
provides
protection
from
harmful
UV
radiation
.
There
is
no
easy
way
to
determine
when
clothing
was
first
developed
,
but
some
information
has
been
inferred
by
studying
lice
.
The
body
louse
specifically
lives
in
clothing
,
and
diverge
from
head
lice
about
107,000
years
ago
,
suggesting
that
clothing
existed
at
that
time
.
Another
theory
is
that
modern
humans
are
the
only
survivors
of
several
species
of
primates
who
may
have
worn
clothes
and
that
clothing
may
have
been
used
as
long
ago
as
650
thousand
years
ago
.
Other
louse
-
based
estimates
put
the
introduction
of
clothing
at
around
42,000
–
72,000
BP
.
The
most
obvious
function
of
clothing
is
to
improve
the
comfort
of
the
wearer
,
by
protecting
the
wearer
from
the
elements
.
In
hot
climates
,
clothing
provides
protection
from
sunburn
or
wind
damage
,
while
in
cold
climates
its
thermal
insulation
properties
are
generally
more
important
.
Shelter
usually
reduces
the
functional
need
for
clothing
.
For
example
,
coats
,
hats
,
gloves
,
and
other
superficial
layers
are
normally
removed
when
entering
a
warm
home
,
particularly
if
one
is
residing
or
sleeping
there
.
Similarly
,
clothing
has
seasonal
and
regional
aspects
,
so
that
thinner
materials
and
fewer
layers
of
clothing
are
generally
worn
in
warmer
seasons
and
regions
than
in
colder
ones
.
Clothing
can
and
has
in
history
been
made
from
a
very
wide
variety
of
materials
.
Materials
have
ranged
from
leather
and
furs
,
to
woven
materials
,
to
elaborate
and
exotic
natural
and
synthetic
fabrics
.
Not
all
body
coverings
are
regarded
as
clothing
.
Articles
carried
rather
than
worn
(
such
as
purses
)
,
worn
on
a
single
part
of
the
body
and
easily
removed
(
scarves
)
,
worn
purely
for
adornment
(
jewelry
)
,
or
those
that
serve
a
function
other
than
protection
(
eyeglasses
)
,
are
normally
considered
accessories
rather
than
clothing
,
as
are
footwear
and
hats
.
Clothing
protects
against
many
things
that
might
injure
the
uncovered
human
body
.
Clothes
protect
people
from
the
elements
,
including
rain
,
snow
,
wind
,
and
other
weather
,
as
well
as
from
the
sun
.
However
,
clothing
that
is
too
sheer
,
thin
,
small
,
tight
,
etc.
,
offers
less
protection
.
Clothes
also
reduce
risk
during
activities
such
as
work
or
sport
.
Some
clothing
protects
from
specific
environmental
hazards
,
such
as
insects
,
noxious
chemicals
,
weather
,
weapons
,
and
contact
with
abrasive
substances
.
Conversely
,
clothing
may
protect
the
environment
from
the
clothing
wearer
,
as
with
doctors
wearing
medical
scrubs
.
Humans
have
shown
extreme
inventiveness
in
devising
clothing
solutions
to
environmental
hazards
.
Examples
include
:
space
suits
,
air
conditioned
clothing
,
armor
,
diving
suits
,
swimsuits
,
bee-keeper
gear
,
motorcycle
leathers
,
high-
visibility
clothing
,
and
other
pieces
of
protective
clothing
.
Meanwhile
,
the
distinction
between
clothing
and
protective
equipment
is
not
always
clear-cut
—
since
clothes
designed
to
be
fashionable
often
have
protective
value
and
clothes
designed
for
function
often
consider
fashion
in
their
design
.
Wearing
clothes
also
has
social
implications
.
They
cover
parts
of
the
body
that
social
norms
require
to
be
covered
,
act
as
a
form
of
adornment
,
and
serve
other
social
purposes
.
Although
dissertations
on
clothing
and
its
function
appear
from
the
19th
century
as
colonising
countries
dealt
with
new
environments
,
concerted
scientific
research
into
psycho-social
,
physiological
and
other
functions
of
clothing
(
e.g.
protective
,
cartage
)
occurred
in
the
first
half
of
the
20th
century
,
with
publications
such
as
J.
C.
Flügel
's
Psychology
of
Clothes
in
1930
,
and
Newburgh
's
seminal
Physiology
of
Heat
Regulation
and
The
Science
of
Clothing
in
1949
.
By
1968
,
the
field
of
environmental
physiology
had
advanced
and
expanded
significantly
,
but
the
science
of
clothing
in
relation
to
environmental
physiology
had
changed
little
.
While
considerable
research
has
since
occurred
and
the
knowledge
-
base
has
grown
significantly
,
the
main
concepts
remain
unchanged
,
and
indeed
Newburgh
's
book
is
still
cited
by
contemporary
authors
,
including
those
attempting
to
develop
thermoregulatory
models
of
clothing
development
.
In
Western
societies
,
skirts
,
dresses
and
high-heeled
shoes
are
usually
seen
as
women
's
clothing
,
while
neckties
are
usually
seen
as
men's
clothing
.
Trousers
were
once
seen
as
exclusively
male
clothing
,
but
are
nowadays
worn
by
both
genders
.
Male
clothes
are
often
more
practical
(
that
is
,
they
can
function
well
under
a
wide
variety
of
situations
)
,
but
a
wider
range
of
clothing
styles
are
available
for
females
.
Males
are
typically
allowed
to
bare
their
chests
in
a
greater
variety
of
public
places
.
It
is
generally
acceptable
for
a
woman
to
wear
traditionally
male
clothing
,
while
the
converse
is
unusual
.
In
some
societies
,
clothing
may
be
used
to
indicate
rank
or
status
.
In
ancient
Rome
,
for
example
,
only
senators
could
wear
garments
dyed
with
Tyrian
purple
.
In
traditional
Hawaiian
society
,
only
high-
ranking
chiefs
could
wear
feather
cloaks
and
palaoa
,
or
carved
whale
teeth
.
Under
the
Travancore
Kingdom
of
Kerala
,
(
India
)
,
lower
caste
women
had
to
pay
a
tax
for
the
right
to
cover
their
upper
body
.
In
China
,
before
establishment
of
the
republic
,
only
the
emperor
could
wear
yellow
.
History
provides
many
examples
of
elaborate
sumptuary
laws
that
regulated
what
people
could
wear
.
In
societies
without
such
laws
,
which
includes
most
modern
societies
,
social
status
is
instead
signaled
by
the
purchase
of
rare
or
luxury
items
that
are
limited
by
cost
to
those
with
wealth
or
status
.
In
addition
,
peer
pressure
influences
clothing
choice
.
According
to
archaeologists
and
anthropologists
,
the
earliest
clothing
likely
consisted
of
fur
,
leather
,
leaves
,
or
grass
that
were
draped
,
wrapped
,
or
tied
around
the
body
.
Knowledge
of
such
clothing
remains
inferential
,
since
clothing
materials
deteriorate
quickly
compared
to
stone
,
bone
,
shell
and
metal
artifacts
.
Archeologists
have
identified
very
early
sewing
needles
of
bone
and
ivory
from
about
30,000
BC
,
found
near
Kostenki
,
Russia
in
1988
.
Dyed
flax
fibers
that
could
have
been
used
in
clothing
have
been
found
in
a
prehistoric
cave
in
the
Republic
of
Georgia
that
date
back
to
36,000
BP
.
Scientists
are
still
debating
when
people
started
wearing
clothes
.
Ralf
Kittler
,
Manfred
Kayser
and
Mark
Stoneking
,
anthropologists
at
the
Max
Planck
Institute
for
Evolutionary
Anthropology
,
have
conducted
a
genetic
analysis
of
human
body
lice
that
suggests
clothing
originated
quite
recently
,
around
170,000
years
ago
.
Body
lice
is
an
indicator
of
clothes
-
wearing
,
since
most
humans
have
sparse
body
hair
,
and
lice
thus
require
human
clothing
to
survive
.
Their
research
suggests
the
invention
of
clothing
may
have
coincided
with
the
northward
migration
of
modern
Homo
sapiens
away
from
the
warm
climate
of
Africa
,
thought
to
have
begun
between
50,000
and
100,000
years
ago
.
However
,
a
second
group
of
researchers
using
similar
genetic
methods
estimate
that
clothing
originated
around
540,000
years
ago
(
Reed
et
al.
2004
.
PLoS
Biology
2
(

)
:
e340
)
.
For
now
,
the
date
of
the
origin
of
clothing
remains
unresolved
.

Different
cultures
have
evolved
various
ways
of
creating
clothes
out
of
cloth
.
One
approach
simply
involves
draping
the
cloth
.
Many
people
wore
,
and
still
wear
,
garments
consisting
of
rectangles
of
cloth
wrapped
to
fit
–
for
example
,
the
dhoti
for
men
and
the
sari
for
women
in
the
Indian
subcontinent
,
the
Scottish
kilt
or
the
Javanese
sarong
.
The
clothes
may
simply
be
tied
up
,
as
is
the
case
of
the
first
two
garments
;
or
pins
or
belts
hold
the
garments
in
place
,
as
in
the
case
of
the
latter
two
.
The
precious
cloth
remains
uncut
,
and
people
of
various
sizes
or
the
same
person
at
different
sizes
can
wear
the
garment
.
By
the
early
years
of
the
21st
century
,
western
clothing
styles
had
,
to
some
extent
,
become
international
styles
.
This
process
began
hundreds
of
years
earlier
,
during
the
periods
of
European
colonialism
.
The
process
of
cultural
dissemination
has
perpetuated
over
the
centuries
as
Western
media
corporations
have
penetrated
markets
throughout
the
world
,
spreading
Western
culture
and
styles
.
Fast
fashion
clothing
has
also
become
a
global
phenomenon
.
These
garments
are
less
expensive
,
mass
-produced
Western
clothing
.
Donated
used
clothing
from
Western
countries
are
also
delivered
to
people
in
poor
countries
by
charity
organizations
.
Most
sports
and
physical
activities
are
practiced
wearing
special
clothing
,
for
practical
,
comfort
or
safety
reasons
.
Common
sportswear
garments
include
shorts
,
T-shirts
,
tennis
shirts
,
leotards
,
tracksuits
,
and
trainers
.
Specialized
garments
include
wet
suits
(
for
swimming
,
diving
or
surfing
)
,
salopettes
(
for
skiing
)
and
leotards
(
for
gymnastics
)
.
Also
,
spandex
materials
are
often
used
as
base
layers
to
soak
up
sweat
.
Spandex
is
also
preferable
for
active
sports
that
require
form
fitting
garments
,
such
as
volleyball
,
wrestling
,
track
&
field
,
dance
,
gymnastics
and
swimming
.
The
world
of
clothing
is
always
changing
,
as
new
cultural
influences
meet
technological
innovations
.
Researchers
in
scientific
labs
have
been
developing
prototypes
for
fabrics
that
can
serve
functional
purposes
well
beyond
their
traditional
roles
,
for
example
,
clothes
that
can
automatically
adjust
their
temperature
,
repel
bullets
,
project
images
,
and
generate
electricity
.
Some
practical
advances
already
available
to
consumers
are
bullet-resistant
garments
made
with
kevlar
and
stain-resistant
fabrics
that
are
coated
with
chemical
mixtures
that
reduce
the
absorption
of
liquids
.
Though
mechanization
transformed
most
aspects
of
human
industry
by
the
mid-20th
century
,
garment
workers
have
continued
to
labor
under
challenging
conditions
that
demand
repetitive
manual
labor
.
Mass-
produced
clothing
is
often
made
in
what
are
considered
by
some
to
be
sweatshops
,
typified
by
long
work
hours
,
lack
of
benefits
,
and
lack
of
worker
representation
.
While
most
examples
of
such
conditions
are
found
in
developing
countries
,
clothes
made
in
industrialized
nations
may
also
be
manufactured
similarly
,
often
staffed
by
undocumented
immigrants
.

Outsourcing
production
to
low
wage
countries
like
Bangladesh
,
China
,
India
and
Sri
Lanka
became
possible
when
the
Multi
Fibre
Agreement
(
MFA
)
was
abolished
.
The
MFA
,
which
placed
quotas
on
textiles
imports
,
was
deemed
a
protectionist
measure

Globalization
is
often
quoted
as
the
single
most
contributing
factor
to
the
poor
working
conditions
of
garment
workers
.
Although
many
countries
recognize
treaties
like
the
International
Labor
Organization
,
which
attempt
to
set
standards
for
worker
safety
and
rights
,
many
countries
have
made
exceptions
to
certain
parts
of
the
treaties
or
failed
to
thoroughly
enforce
them
.
India
for
example
has
not
ratified
sections
87
and
92
of
the
treaty
.

The
use
of
animal
fur
in
clothing
dates
to
prehistoric
times
.
It
is
currently
associated
in
developed
countries
with
expensive
,
designer
clothing
,
although
fur
is
still
used
by
indigenous
people
in
arctic
zones
and
higher
elevations
for
its
warmth
and
protection
.
Once
uncontroversial
,
it
has
recently
been
the
focus
of
campaigns
on
the
grounds
that
campaigners
consider
it
cruel
and
unnecessary
.
PETA
,
along
with
other
animal
rights
and
animal
liberation
groups
have
called
attention
to
fur
farming
and
other
practices
they
consider
cruel
.
Many
kinds
of
clothing
are
designed
to
be
ironed
before
they
are
worn
to
remove
wrinkles
.
Most
modern
formal
and
semi-formal
clothing
is
in
this
category
(
for
example
,
dress
shirts
and
suits
)
.
Ironed
clothes
are
believed
to
look
clean
,
fresh
,
and
neat
.
Much
contemporary
casual
clothing
is
made
of
knit
materials
that
do
not
readily
wrinkle
,
and
do
not
require
ironing
.
Some
clothing
is
permanent
press
,
having
been
treated
with
a
coating
(
such
as
polytetrafluoroethylene
)
that
suppresses
wrinkles
and
creates
a
smooth
appearance
without
ironing
.
A
resin
used
for
making
non-wrinkle
shirts
releases
formaldehyde
,
which
could
cause
contact
dermatitis
for
some
people
;
no
disclosure
requirements
exist
,
and
in
2008
the
U.S.
Government
Accountability
Office
tested
formaldehyde
in
clothing
and
found
that
generally
the
highest
levels
were
in
non-wrinkle
shirts
and
pants
.
In
1999
,
a
study
of
the
effect
of
washing
on
the
formaldehyde
levels
found
that
after
6
months
after
washing
,
7
of
27
shirts
had
levels
in
excess
of
75
ppm
,
which
is
a
safe
limit
for
direct
skin
exposure
.
In
past
times
,
mending
was
an
art
.
A
meticulous
tailor
or
seamstress
could
mend
rips
with
thread
raveled
from
hems
and
seam
edges
so
skillfully
that
the
tear
was
practically
invisible
.
When
the
raw
material
–
cloth
–
was
worth
more
than
labor
,
it
made
sense
to
expend
labor
in
saving
it
.
Today
clothing
is
considered
a
consumable
item
.
Mass-manufactured
clothing
is
less
expensive
than
the
labor
required
to
repair
it
.
Many
people
buy
a
new
piece
of
clothing
rather
than
spend
time
mending
.
The
thrifty
still
replace
zippers
and
buttons
and
sew
up
ripped
hems
.

[
a
]
was
started
when
North
Korea
invaded
South
Korea
.
The
United
Nations
,
with
United
States
as
the
principal
force
,
came
to
aid
of
South
Korea
.
China
,
along
with
assistance
from
Soviet
Union
,
came
to
aid
of
North
Korea
.
The
war
arose
from
the
division
of
Korea
at
the
end
of
World
War
II
and
from
the
global
tensions
of
the
Cold
War
that
developed
immediately
afterwards
.
Korea
was
ruled
by
Japan
from
1910
until
the
closing
days
of
World
War
II
.
In
August
1945
,
the
Soviet
Union
declared
war
on
Japan
and
—
by
agreement
with
the
United
States
—
occupied
Korea
north
of
the
38th
parallel
.
U.S.
forces
subsequently
occupied
the
south
and
Japan
surrendered
.
By
1948
,
two
separate
governments
had
been
set
up
.
Both
governments
claimed
to
be
the
legitimate
government
of
Korea
,
and
neither
side
accepted
the
border
as
permanent
.
The
conflict
escalated
into
open
warfare
when
North
Korean
forces
—
supported
by
the
Soviet
Union
and
China—
invaded
South
Korea
on
25
June
1950
.
On
that
day
,
the
United
Nations
Security
Council
recognized
this
North
Korean
act
as
invasion
and
called
for
an
immediate
ceasefire
.
On
27
June
,
the
Security
Council
adopted
S
/RES
/83
:
Complaint
of
aggression
upon
the
Republic
of
Korea
and
decided
the
formation
and
dispatch
of
the
UN
Forces
in
Korea
.
Twenty
-
one
countries
of
the
United
Nations
eventually
contributed
to
the
defense
of
South
Korea
,
with
the
United
States
providing
88
%
of
the
UN
's
military
personnel
.
After
the
first
two
months
of
the
conflict
,
South
Korean
forces
were
on
the
point
of
defeat
,
forced
back
to
the
Pusan
Perimeter
.
In
September
1950
,
an
amphibious
UN
counter
-offensive
was
launched
at
Inchon
,
and
cut
off
many
of
the
North
Korean
attackers
.
Those
that
escaped
envelopment
and
capture
were
rapidly
forced
back
north
all
the
way
to
the
border
with
China
at
the
Yalu
River
,
or
into
the
mountainous
interior
.
At
this
point
,
in
October
1950
,
Chinese
forces
crossed
the
Yalu
and
entered
the
war
.
Chinese
intervention
triggered
a
retreat
of
UN
forces
which
continued
until
mid
-1951
.
After
these
dramatic
reversals
of
fortune
,
which
saw
Seoul
change
hands
four
times
,
the
last
two
years
of
conflict
became
a
war
of
attrition
,
with
the
front
line
close
to
the
38th
parallel
.
The
war
in
the
air
,
however
,
was
never
a
stalemate
.
North
Korea
was
subject
to
a
massive
bombing
campaign
.
Jet
fighters
confronted
each
other
in
air-to
-
air
combat
for
the
first
time
in
history
,
and
Soviet
pilots
covertly
flew
in
defense
of
their
Communist
allies
.
In
China
,
the
war
is
officially
called
the
"
War

more

such

and
Macau
.
Korea
was
considered
to
be
part
of
the
Empire
of
Japan
as
an
industrialized
colony
along
with
Taiwan
,
and
both
were
part
of
the
Greater
East
Asia
Co-Prosperity
Sphere
.
In
1937
,
the
colonial
Governor-General
,
General
Jirō
Minami
,
commanded
the
attempted
cultural
assimilation
of
Korea
's
23.5
million
people
by
banning
the
use
and
study
of
Korean
language
,
literature
,
and
culture
,
to
be
replaced
with
that
of
mandatory
use
and
study
of
their
Japanese
counterparts
.
Starting
in
1939
,
the
populace
was
required
to
use
Japanese
names
under
the
Sōshi-kaimei
policy
.
Conscription
of
Koreans
for
labor
in
war
industries
began
in
1939
,
with
as
many
as
2
million
Koreans
conscripted
into
either
the
Japanese
Army
or
into
the
Japanese
labor
force
.
During
World
War
II
,
Japan
used
Korea
's
food
,
livestock
,
and
metals
for
their
war
effort
.
Japanese
forces
in
Korea
increased
from
46,000
soldiers
in
1941
to
300,000
in
1945
.
Japanese
Korea
conscripted
2.6
million
forced
laborers
controlled
with
a
collaborationist
Korean
police
force
;
some
723,000
people
were
sent
to
work
in
the
overseas
empire
and
in
metropolitan
Japan
.
By
1942
,
Korean
men
were
being
conscripted
into
the
Imperial
Japanese
Army
.
By
January
1945
,
Koreans
made
up
32
%
of
Japan
's
labor
force
.
At
the
end
of
the
war
,
other
world
powers
did
not
recognize
Japanese
rule
in
Korea
and
Taiwan
.
On
the
night
of
10
August
in
Washington
,
American
Colonels
Dean
Rusk
and
Charles
H.
Bonesteel
III
were
tasked
with
dividing
the
Korean
Peninsula
into
Soviet
and
U.S.
occupation
zones
and
proposed
the
38th
parallel
.
This
was
incorporated
into
America
's
General
Order
No
.
1
which
responded
to
the
Japanese
surrender
on
15
August
.
Explaining
the
choice
of
the
38th
parallel
,
Rusk
observed
,
"
even
though
it
was
further
north
than
could
be
realistically
reached
by
U.S.
forces
,
in
the
event
of
Soviet
disagreement
...
we
felt
it
important
to
include
the
capital
of
Korea
in
the
area
of
responsibility
of
American
troops
"
.
He
noted
that
he
was
"
faced
with
the
scarcity
of
US
forces
immediately
available
,
and
time
and
space
factors
,
which
would
make
it
difficult
to
reach
very
far
north
,
before
Soviet
troops
could
enter
the
area
"
.
As
Rusk
's
comments
indicate
,
the
Americans
doubted
whether
the
Soviet
government
would
agree
to
this
.
Stalin
,
however
,
maintained
his
wartime
policy
of
co-operation
,
and
on
16
August
the
Red
Army
halted
at
the
38th
parallel
for
three
weeks
to
await
the
arrival
of
U.S.
forces
in
the
south
.
On
8
September
1945
,
U.S.
Lt.
Gen.
John
R.
Hodge
arrived
in
Incheon
to
accept
the
Japanese
surrender
south
of
the
38th
parallel
.
Appointed
as
military
governor
,
General
Hodge
directly
controlled
South
Korea
as
head
of
the
United
States
Army
Military
Government
in
Korea
(
USAMGIK
1945
–
48
)
.
He
established
control
by
restoring
to
power
the
key
Japanese
colonial
administrators
,
but
in
the
face
of
Korean
protests
he
quickly
reversed
this
decision
.
The
USAMGIK
refused
to
recognize
the
provisional
government
of
the
short-
lived
People
's
Republic
of
Korea
(
PRK
)
because
it
suspected
it
was
communist
.
On
23
September
1946
,
an
8,000
-
strong
railroad
worker
strike
began
in
Pusan
.
Civil
disorder
spread
throughout
the
country
in
what
became
known
as
the
Autumn
uprising
.
On
1
October
1946
,
Korean
police
killed
three
students
in
the
Daegu
Uprising
;
protesters
counter-attacked
,
killing
38
policemen
.
On
3
October
,
some
10,000
people
attacked
the
Yeongcheon
police
station
,
killing
three
policemen
and
injuring
some
40
more
;
elsewhere
,
some
20
landlords
and
pro-Japanese
South
Korean
officials
were
killed
.
The
USAMGIK
declared
martial
law
.
Citing
the
inability
of
the
Joint
Commission
to
make
progress
,
the
U.S.
government
decided
to
hold
an
election
under
United
Nations
auspices
with
the
aim
of
creating
an
independent
Korea
.
The
Soviet
authorities
and
the
Korean
Communists
refused
to
co-operate
on
the
grounds
it
would
not
be
fair
,
and
many
South
Korean
politicians
also
boycotted
it
.
A
general
election
was
held
in
the
South
on
10
May
1948
.
It
was
marred
by
terrorism
and
sabotage
resulting
in
600
deaths
.
North
Korea
held
parliamentary
elections
three
months
later
on
25
August
.
The
resultant
South
Korean
government
promulgated
a
national
political
constitution
on
17
July
1948
,
and
elected
Syngman
Rhee
as
President
on
20
July
1948
.
The
Republic
of
Korea
(
South
Korea
)
was
established
on
15
August
1948
.
In
the
Russian
Korean
Zone
of
Occupation
,
the
Soviet
Union
established
a
Communist
North
Korean
government
led
by
Kim
Il-sung
.
President
Rhee
's
régime
excluded
communists
and
leftists
from
southern
politics
.
Disenfranchised
,
they
headed
for
the
hills
,
to
prepare
for
guerrilla
war
against
the
US
-
sponsored
ROK
Government
.
With
the
end
of
the
war
with
Japan
,
the
Chinese
Civil
War
resumed
between
the
Chinese
Communists
and
the
Chinese
Nationalists
.
While
the
Communists
were
struggling
for
supremacy
in
Manchuria
,
they
were
supported
by
the
North
Korean
government
with
matériel
and
manpower
.
According
to
Chinese
sources
,
the
North
Koreans
donated
2,000
railway
cars
worth
of
matériel
while
thousands
of
Koreans
served
in
the
Chinese
People
's
Liberation
Army
(
PLA
)
during
the
war
.
North
Korea
also
provided
the
Chinese
Communists
in
Manchuria
with
a
safe
refuge
for
non-combatants
and
communications
with
the
rest
of
China
.
The
North
Korean
contributions
to
the
Chinese
Communist
victory
were
not
forgotten
after
the
creation
of
the
People
's
Republic
of
China
in
1949
.
As
a
token
of
gratitude
,
between
50,000
and
70,000
Korean
veterans
that
served
in
the
PLA
were
sent
back
along
with
their
weapons
,
and
they
later
played
a
significant
role
in
the
initial
invasion
of
South
Korea
.
China
promised
to
support
the
North
Koreans
in
the
event
of
a
war
against
South
Korea
.
The
Chinese
support
created
a
deep
division
between
the
Korean
Communists
,
and
Kim
Il-sung
's
authority
within
the
Communist
party
was
challenged
by
the
Chinese
faction
led
by
Pak
Il-yu
,
who
was
later
purged
by
Kim
.
After
the
formation
of
the
People
's
Republic
of
China
in
1949
,
the
Chinese
government
named
the
Western
nations
,
led
by
the
United
States
,
as
the
biggest
threat
to
its
national
security
.
Basing
this
judgment
on
China
's
century
of
humiliation
beginning
in
the
early
19th
century
,
American
support
for
the
Nationalists
during
the
Chinese
Civil
War
,
and
the
ideological
struggles
between
revolutionaries
and
reactionaries
,
the
Chinese
leadership
believed
that
China
would
become
a
critical
battleground
in
the
United
States
'
crusade
against
Communism
.
As
a
countermeasure
and
to
elevate
China
's
standing
among
the
worldwide
Communist
movements
,
the
Chinese
leadership
adopted
a
foreign
policy
that
actively
promoted
Communist
revolutions
throughout
territories
on
China
's
periphery
.
By
spring
1950
,
Stalin
believed
the
strategic
situation
had
changed
.
The
Soviets
had
detonated
their
first
nuclear
bomb
in
September
1949
;
American
soldiers
had
fully
withdrawn
from
Korea
;
the
Americans
had
not
intervened
to
stop
the
communist
victory
in
China
,
and
Stalin
calculated
that
the
Americans
would
be
even
less
willing
to
fight
in
Korea
—
which
had
seemingly
much
less
strategic
significance
.
The
Soviets
had
also
cracked
the
codes
used
by
the
US
to
communicate
with
the
US
embassy
in
Moscow
,
and
reading
these
dispatches
convinced
Stalin
that
Korea
did
not
have
the
importance
to
the
US
that
would
warrant
a
nuclear
confrontation
.
Stalin
began
a
more
aggressive
strategy
in
Asia
based
on
these
developments
,
including
promising
economic
and
military
aid
to
China
through
the
Sino–Soviet
Friendship
,
Alliance
,
and
Mutual
Assistance
Treaty
.
In
April
1950
,
Stalin
gave
Kim
permission
to
invade
the
South
under
the
condition
that
Mao
would
agree
to
send
reinforcements
if
they
became
needed
.
Stalin
made
it
clear
that
Soviet
forces
would
not
openly
engage
in
combat
,
to
avoid
a
direct
war
with
the
Americans
.
Kim
met
with
Mao
in
May
1950
.
Mao
was
concerned
that
the
Americans
would
intervene
but
agreed
to
support
the
North
Korean
invasion
.
China
desperately
needed
the
economic
and
military
aid
promised
by
the
Soviets
.
At
that
time
,
the
Chinese
were
in
the
process
of
demobilizing
half
of
the
PLA
's
5.6
million
soldiers
.
However
,
Mao
sent
more
ethnic
Korean
PLA
veterans
to
Korea
and
promised
to
move
an
army
closer
to
the
Korean
border
.
Once
Mao
's
commitment
was
secured
,
preparations
for
war
accelerated
.
Soviet
generals
with
extensive
combat
experience
from
the
Second
World
War
were
sent
to
North
Korea
as
the
Soviet
Advisory
Group
.
These
generals
completed
the
plans
for
the
attack
by
May
.
The
original
plans
called
for
a
skirmish
to
be
initiated
in
the
Ongjin
Peninsula
on
the
west
coast
of
Korea
.
The
North
Koreans
would
then
launch
a
"
counterattack
"
that
would
capture
Seoul
and
encircle
and
destroy
the
South
Korean
army
.
The
final
stage
would
involve
destroying
South
Korean
government
remnants
,
capturing
the
rest
of
South
Korea
,
including
the
ports
.
On
7
June
1950
,
Kim
Il-sung
called
for
a
Korea-wide
election
on
5–8
August
1950
and
a
consultative
conference
in
Haeju
on
15
–
17
June
1950
.
On
11
June
,
the
North
sent
three
diplomats
to
the
South
,
as
a
peace
overture
that
Rhee
rejected
.
On
21
June
,
Kim
Il
-
Sung
revised
his
war
plan
to
involve
general
attack
across
the
38th
parallel
,
rather
than
a
limited
operation
in
the
Ongjin
peninsula
.
Kim
was
concerned
that
South
Korean
agents
had
learned
about
the
plans
and
South
Korean
forces
were
strengthening
their
defenses
.
Stalin
agreed
to
this
change
of
plan
.
While
these
preparations
were
underway
in
the
North
,
there
were
frequent
clashes
along
the
38th
parallel
,
especially
at
Kaesong
and
Ongjin
,
many
initiated
by
the
South
.
The
Republic
of
Korea
Army
(
ROK
Army
)
was
being
trained
by
the
U.S.
Korean
Military
Advisory
Group
(
KMAG
)
.
On
the
eve
of
war
,
KMAG
's
commander
General
William
Lynn
Roberts
voiced
utmost
confidence
in
the
ROK
Army
and
boasted
that
any
North
Korean
invasion
would
merely
provide
"
target
practice
"
.
For
his
part
,
Syngman
Rhee
repeatedly
expressed
his
desire
to
conquer
the
North
,
including
when
American
diplomat
John
Foster
Dulles
visited
Korea
on
18
June
.
At
dawn
on
Sunday
,
25
June
1950
,
the
Korean
People
's
Army
crossed
the
38th
parallel
behind
artillery
fire
.
The
KPA
justified
its
assault
with
the
claim
that
ROK
troops
had
attacked
first
,
and
that
they
were
aiming
to
arrest
and
execute
the
"
bandit
traitor
Syngman
Rhee
"
.
Fighting
began
on
the
strategic
Ongjin
peninsula
in
the
west
.
There
were
initial
South
Korean
claims
that
they
had
captured
the
city
of
Haeju
,
and
this
sequence
of
events
has
led
some
scholars
to
argue
that
the
South
Koreans
actually
fired
first
.
On
27
June
,
Rhee
evacuated
from
Seoul
with
some
of
the
government
.
On
28
June
,
at
2
am
,
the
South
Korean
Army
blew
up
the
highway
bridge
across
the
Han
River
in
an
attempt
to
stop
the
North
Korean
army
.
The
bridge
was
detonated
while
4,000
refugees
were
crossing
the
bridge
,
and
hundreds
were
killed
.
Destroying
the
bridge
also
trapped
many
South
Korean
military
units
north
of
the
Han
River
.
In
spite
of
such
desperate
measures
,
Seoul
fell
that
same
day
.
A
number
of
South
Korean
National
Assemblymen
remained
in
Seoul
when
it
fell
,
and
forty
-
eight
subsequently
pledged
allegiance
to
the
North
.
One
facet
of
the
changing
attitude
toward
Korea
and
whether
to
get
involved
was
Japan
.
Especially
after
the
fall
of
China
to
the
Communists
,
U.S.
East
Asian
experts
saw
Japan
as
the
critical
counterweight
to
the
Soviet
Union
and
China
in
the
region
.
While
there
was
no
United
States
policy
that
dealt
with
South
Korea
directly
as
a
national
interest
,
its
proximity
to
Japan
increased
the
importance
of
South
Korea
.
Said
Kim
:
"
The
recognition
that
the
security
of
Japan
required
a
non-hostile
Korea
led
directly
to
President
Truman
's
decision
to
intervene
...
The
essential
point
...
is
that
the
American
response
to
the
North
Korean
attack
stemmed
from
considerations
of
US
policy
toward
Japan
.
"
A
major
consideration
was
the
possible
Soviet
reaction
in
the
event
that
the
US
intervened
.
The
Truman
administration
was
fretful
that
a
war
in
Korea
was
a
diversionary
assault
that
would
escalate
to
a
general
war
in
Europe
once
the
United
States
committed
in
Korea
.
At
the
same
time
,
"
[
t]
here
was
no
suggestion
from
anyone
that
the
United
Nations
or
the
United
States
could
back
away
from
[
the
conflict
]
"
.
Yugoslavia–a
possible
Soviet
target
because
of
the
Tito-Stalin
Split
—
was
vital
to
the
defense
of
Italy
and
Greece
,
and
the
country
was
first
on
the
list
of
the
National
Security
Council
's
post
-
North
Korea
invasion
list
of
"
chief
danger
spots
"
.
Truman
believed
if
aggression
went
unchecked
a
chain
reaction
would
be
initiated
that
would
marginalize
the
United
Nations
and
encourage
Communist
aggression
elsewhere
.
The
UN
Security
Council
approved
the
use
of
force
to
help
the
South
Koreans
and
the
US
immediately
began
using
what
air
and
naval
forces
that
were
in
the
area
to
that
end
.
The
Administration
still
refrained
from
committing
on
the
ground
because
some
advisers
believed
the
North
Koreans
could
be
stopped
by
air
and
naval
power
alone
.
On
25
June
1950
,
the
United
Nations
Security
Council
unanimously
condemned
the
North
Korean
invasion
of
the
Republic
of
Korea
,
with
UN
Security
Council
Resolution
82
.
The
Soviet
Union
,
a
veto-wielding
power
,
had
boycotted
the
Council
meetings
since
January
1950
,
protesting
that
the
Republic
of
China
(
Taiwan
)
,
not
the
People
's
Republic
of
China
,
held
a
permanent
seat
in
the
UN
Security
Council
.
After
debating
the
matter
,
the
Security
Council
,
on
27
June
1950
,
published
Resolution
83
recommending
member
states
provide
military
assistance
to
the
Republic
of
Korea
.
On
27
June
President
Truman
ordered
U.S.
air
and
sea
forces
to
help
the
South
Korean
regime
.
On
4
July
the
Soviet
Deputy
Foreign
Minister
accused
the
United
States
of
starting
armed
intervention
on
behalf
of
South
Korea
.
The
Soviet
Union
challenged
the
legitimacy
of
the
war
for
several
reasons
.
The
ROK
Army
intelligence
upon
which
Resolution
83
was
based
came
from
U.S.
Intelligence
;
North
Korea
was
not
invited
as
a
sitting
temporary
member
of
the
UN
,
which
violated
UN
Charter
Article
32
;
and
the
Korean
conflict
was
beyond
the
UN
Charter
's
scope
,
because
the
initial
north
–south
border
fighting
was
classed
as
a
civil
war
.
Because
the
Soviet
Union
was
boycotting
the
Security
Council
at
the
time
,
legal
scholars
posited
that
deciding
upon
an
action
of
this
type
required
the
unanimous
vote
of
the
five
permanent
members
.
By
mid-1950
,
North
Korean
forces
numbered
between
150,000
and
200,000
troops
,
organized
into
10
infantry
divisions
,
one
tank
division
,
and
one
air
force
division
,
with
210
fighter
planes
and
280
tanks
,
who
captured
scheduled
objectives
and
territory
,
among
them
Kaesong
,
Chuncheon
,
Uijeongbu
,
and
Ongjin
.
Their
forces
included
274
T-34
-
85
tanks
,
200
artillery
pieces
,
110
attack
bombers
,
some
150
Yak
fighter
planes
,
78
Yak
trainers
,
and
35
reconnaissance
aircraft
.
In
addition
to
the
invasion
force
,
the
North
KPA
had
114
fighters
,
78
bombers
,
105
T-34
-
85
tanks
,
and
some
30,000
soldiers
stationed
in
reserve
in
North
Korea
.
Although
each
navy
consisted
of
only
several
small
warships
,
the
North
and
South
Korean
navies
fought
in
the
war
as
sea-borne
artillery
for
their
in-country
armies
.
In
contrast
,
the
ROK
Army
defenders
were
relatively
unprepared
and
ill-equipped
.
In
South
to
the
Naktong
,
North
to
the
Yalu
(
1961
)
,
R.E.
Appleman
reports
the
ROK
forces
'
low
combat
readiness
as
of
25
June
1950
.
The
ROK
Army
had
98,000
soldiers
(
65,000
combat
,
33,000
support
)
,
no
tanks
(
they
had
been
requested
from
the
U.S.
military
,
but
requests
were
denied
)
,
and
a
22
-
piece
air
force
comprising
12
liaison
-type
and
10
AT6
advanced
-
trainer
airplanes
.
There
were
no
large
foreign
military
garrisons
in
Korea
at
the
time
of
the
invasion
,
but
there
were
large
U.S.
garrisons
and
air
forces
in
Japan
.
On
Saturday
,
24
June
1950
,
U.S.
Secretary
of
State
Dean
Acheson
informed
President
Truman
that
the
North
Koreans
had
invaded
South
Korea
.
Truman
and
Acheson
discussed
a
U.S.
invasion
response
and
agreed
that
the
United
States
was
obligated
to
act
,
paralleling
the
North
Korean
invasion
with
Adolf
Hitler
's
aggressions
in
the
1930s
,
with
the
conclusion
being
that
the
mistake
of
appeasement
must
not
be
repeated
.
Several
U.S.
industries
were
mobilized
to
supply
materials
,
labor
,
capital
,
production
facilities
,
and
other
services
necessary
to
support
the
military
objectives
of
the
Korean
War
.
However
,
President
Truman
later
acknowledged
that
he
believed
fighting
the
invasion
was
essential
to
the
American
goal
of
the
global
containment
of
communism
as
outlined
in
the
National
Security
Council
Report
68
(
NSC
-
68
)
(
declassified
in
1975
)
:
As
an
initial
response
,
Truman
called
for
a
naval
blockade
of
North
Korea
,
and
was
shocked
to
learn
that
such
a
blockade
could
be
imposed
only
'
on
paper
'
,
since
the
U.S.
Navy
no
longer
had
the
warships
with
which
to
carry
out
his
request
.
In
fact
,
because
of
the
extensive
defense
cuts
and
the
emphasis
placed
on
building
a
nuclear
bomber
force
,
none
of
the
services
were
in
a
position
to
make
a
robust
response
with
conventional
military
strength
.
General
Omar
Bradley
,
Chairman
of
the
Joint
Chiefs
of
Staff
,
was
faced
with
re-organizing
and
deploying
an
American
military
force
that
was
a
shadow
of
its
World
War
II
counterpart
.
The
impact
of
the
Truman
administration
's
defense
budget
cutbacks
were
now
keenly
felt
,
as
American
troops
fought
a
series
of
costly
rearguard
actions
.
Lacking
sufficient
anti-tank
weapons
,
artillery
or
armor
,
they
were
driven
back
down
the
Korean
peninsula
to
Pusan
.
In
a
postwar
analysis
of
the
unpreparedness
of
U.S.
Army
forces
deployed
to
Korea
during
the
summer
and
fall
of
1950
,
Army
Major
General
Floyd
L.
Parks
stated
that
"
Many
who
never
lived
to
tell
the
tale
had
to
fight
the
full
range
of
ground
warfare
from
offensive
to
delaying
action
,
unit
by
unit
,
man
by
man
...
[
T]
hat
we
were
able
to
snatch
victory
from
the
jaws
of
defeat
...
does
not
relieve
us
from
the
blame
of
having
placed
our
own
flesh
and
blood
in
such
a
predicament
.
"
Acting
on
State
Secretary
Acheson
's
recommendation
,
President
Truman
ordered
General
MacArthur
to
transfer
matériel
to
the
Army
of
the
Republic
of
Korea
while
giving
air
cover
to
the
evacuation
of
U.S.
nationals
.
The
President
disagreed
with
advisers
who
recommended
unilateral
U.S.
bombing
of
the
North
Korean
forces
,
and
ordered
the
US
Seventh
Fleet
to
protect
the
Republic
of
China
(
Taiwan
)
,
whose
government
asked
to
fight
in
Korea
.
The
United
States
denied
ROC
's
request
for
combat
,
lest
it
provoke
a
communist
Chinese
retaliation
.
Because
the
United
States
had
sent
the
Seventh
Fleet
to
"
neutralize
"
the
Taiwan
Strait
,
Chinese
premier
Zhou
Enlai
criticized
both
the
UN
and
U.S.
initiatives
as
"
armed
aggression
on
Chinese
territory
.
"
The
Battle
of
Osan
,
the
first
significant
American
engagement
of
the
Korean
War
,
involved
the
540
-
soldier
Task
Force
Smith
,
which
was
a
small
forward
element
of
the
24th
Infantry
Division
which
had
been
flown
in
from
Japan
.
On
5
July
1950
,
Task
Force
Smith
attacked
the
North
Koreans
at
Osan
but
without
weapons
capable
of
destroying
the
North
Koreans
'
tanks
.
They
were
unsuccessful
;
the
result
was
180
dead
,
wounded
,
or
taken
prisoner
.
The
KPA
progressed
southwards
,
pushing
back
the
US
force
at
Pyongtaek
,
Chonan
,
and
Chochiwon
,
forcing
the
24th
Division
's
retreat
to
Taejeon
,
which
the
KPA
captured
in
the
Battle
of
Taejon
;
the
24th
Division
suffered
3,602
dead
and
wounded
and
2,962
captured
,
including
the
Division
's
Commander
,
Major
General
William
F.
Dean
.
By
August
,
the
KPA
had
pushed
back
the
ROK
Army
and
the
Eighth
United
States
Army
to
the
vicinity
of
Pusan
in
southeast
Korea
.
In
their
southward
advance
,
the
KPA
purged
the
Republic
of
Korea
's
intelligentsia
by
killing
civil
servants
and
intellectuals
.
On
20
August
,
General
MacArthur
warned
North
Korean
leader
Kim
Il-sung
that
he
was
responsible
for
the
KPA
's
atrocities
.
By
September
,
the
UN
Command
controlled
the
Pusan
perimeter
,
enclosing
about
10
%
of
Korea
,
in
a
line
partially
defined
by
the
Nakdong
River
.
Although
Kim
's
early
successes
had
led
him
to
predict
that
he
would
end
the
war
by
the
end
of
August
,
Chinese
leaders
were
more
pessimistic
.
To
counter
a
possible
U.S.
deployment
,
Zhou
Enlai
secured
a
Soviet
commitment
to
have
the
Soviet
Union
support
Chinese
forces
with
air
cover
,
and
deployed
260,000
soldiers
along
the
Korean
border
,
under
the
command
of
Gao
Gang
.
Zhou
commanded
Chai
Chengwen
to
conduct
a
topographical
survey
of
Korea
,
and
directed
Lei
Yingfu
,
Zhou
's
military
advisor
in
Korea
,
to
analyze
the
military
situation
in
Korea
.
Lei
concluded
that
MacArthur
would
most
likely
attempt
a
landing
at
Incheon
.
After
conferring
with
Mao
that
this
would
be
MacArthur
's
most
likely
strategy
,
Zhou
briefed
Soviet
and
North
Korean
advisers
of
Lei
's
findings
,
and
issued
orders
to
Chinese
army
commanders
deployed
on
the
Korean
border
to
prepare
for
American
naval
activity
in
the
Korea
Strait
.
In
the
resulting
Battle
of
Pusan
Perimeter
(
August
–September
1950
)
,
the
U.S.
Army
withstood
KPA
attacks
meant
to
capture
the
city
at
the
Naktong
Bulge
,
P'ohang
-dong
,
and
Taegu
.
The
United
States
Air
Force
(
USAF
)
interrupted
KPA
logistics
with
40
daily
ground
support
sorties
that
destroyed
32
bridges
,
halting
most
daytime
road
and
rail
traffic
.
KPA
forces
were
forced
to
hide
in
tunnels
by
day
and
move
only
at
night
.
To
deny
matériel
to
the
KPA
,
the
USAF
destroyed
logistics
depots
,
petroleum
refineries
,
and
harbors
,
while
the
U.S.
Navy
air
forces
attacked
transport
hubs
.
Consequently
,
the
over-extended
KPA
could
not
be
supplied
throughout
the
south
.
On
27
August
,
67th
Fighter
Squadron
aircraft
mistakenly
attacked
facilities
in
Chinese
territory
and
the
Soviet
Union
called
the
UN
Security
Council
's
attention
to
China
's
complaint
about
the
incident
.
The
US
proposed
that
a
commission
of
India
and
Sweden
determine
what
the
US
should
pay
in
compensation
but
the
Soviets
vetoed
the
US
proposal
.
Meanwhile
,
U.S.
garrisons
in
Japan
continually
dispatched
soldiers
and
matériel
to
reinforce
defenders
in
the
Pusan
Perimeter
.
Tank
battalions
deployed
to
Korea
directly
from
the
U.S.
mainland
from
the
port
of
San
Francisco
to
the
port
of
Pusan
,
the
largest
Korean
port
.
By
late
August
,
the
Pusan
Perimeter
had
some
500
medium
tanks
battle-ready
.
In
early
September
1950
,
ROK
Army
and
UN
Command
forces
outnumbered
the
KPA
180,000
to
100,000
soldiers
.
The
UN
forces
,
once
prepared
,
counterattacked
and
broke
out
of
the
Pusan
Perimeter
.
Against
the
rested
and
re-armed
Pusan
Perimeter
defenders
and
their
reinforcements
,
the
KPA
were
undermanned
and
poorly
supplied
;
unlike
the
UN
Command
,
they
lacked
naval
and
air
support
.
To
relieve
the
Pusan
Perimeter
,
General
MacArthur
recommended
an
amphibious
landing
at
Inchon
(
now
known
as
Incheon
)
,
near
Seoul
and
well
over
100
miles
(
160
km
)
behind
the
KPA
lines
.
On
6
July
,
he
ordered
Major
General
Hobart
R.
Gay
,
Commander
,
1st
Cavalry
Division
,
to
plan
the
division
's
amphibious
landing
at
Incheon
;
on
12
–
14
July
,
the
1st
Cavalry
Division
embarked
from
Yokohama
,
Japan
to
reinforce
the
24th
Infantry
Division
inside
the
Pusan
Perimeter
.
Soon
after
the
war
began
,
General
MacArthur
had
begun
planning
a
landing
at
Incheon
,
but
the
Pentagon
opposed
him
.
When
authorized
,
he
activated
a
combined
U.S.
Army
and
Marine
Corps
,
and
ROK
Army
force
.
The
X
Corps
,
led
by
General
Edward
Almond
,
Commander
,
consisted
of
40,000
men
of
the
1st
Marine
Division
,
the
7th
Infantry
Division
and
around
8,600
ROK
Army
soldiers
.
By
15
September
,
the
amphibious
assault
force
faced
few
KPA
defenders
at
Incheon
:
military
intelligence
,
psychological
warfare
,
guerrilla
reconnaissance
,
and
protracted
bombardment
facilitated
a
relatively
light
battle
.
However
,
the
bombardment
destroyed
most
of
the
city
of
Incheon
.
After
the
Incheon
landing
,
the
1st
Cavalry
Division
began
its
northward
advance
from
the
Pusan
Perimeter
.
"
Task
Force
Lynch
"
(
after
Lieutenant
Colonel
James
H.
Lynch
)
,
3rd
Battalion
,
7th
Cavalry
Regiment
,
and
two
70th
Tank
Battalion
units
(
Charlie
Company
and
the
Intelligence
–Reconnaissance
Platoon
)
effected
the
"
Pusan
Perimeter
Breakout
"
through
106.4
miles
(
171.2
km
)
of
enemy
territory
to
join
the
7th
Infantry
Division
at
Osan
.
The
X
Corps
rapidly
defeated
the
KPA
defenders
around
Seoul
,
thus
threatening
to
trap
the
main
KPA
force
in
Southern
Korea
.
On
18
September
,
Stalin
dispatched
General
H.
M.
Zakharov
to
Korea
to
advise
Kim
Il-sung
to
halt
his
offensive
around
the
Pusan
perimeter
and
to
redeploy
his
forces
to
defend
Seoul
.
Chinese
commanders
were
not
briefed
on
North
Korean
troop
numbers
or
operational
plans
.
As
the
overall
commander
of
Chinese
forces
,
Zhou
Enlai
suggested
that
the
North
Koreans
should
attempt
to
eliminate
the
enemy
forces
at
Inchon
only
if
they
had
reserves
of
at
least
100,000
men
;
otherwise
,
he
advised
the
North
Koreans
to
withdraw
their
forces
north
.
On
25
September
,
Seoul
was
recaptured
by
South
Korean
forces
.
American
air
raids
caused
heavy
damage
to
the
KPA
,
destroying
most
of
its
tanks
and
much
of
its
artillery
.
North
Korean
troops
in
the
south
,
instead
of
effectively
withdrawing
north
,
rapidly
disintegrated
,
leaving
Pyongyang
vulnerable
.
During
the
general
retreat
only
25,000
to
30,000
soldiers
managed
to
rejoin
the
Northern
KPA
lines
.
On
27
September
,
Stalin
convened
an
emergency
session
of
the
Politburo
,
in
which
he
condemned
the
incompetence
of
the
KPA
command
and
held
Soviet
military
advisers
responsible
for
the
defeat
.
On
27
September
,
MacArthur
received
the
top
secret
National
Security
Council
Memorandum
81/1
from
Truman
reminding
him
that
operations
north
of
the
38th
parallel
were
authorized
only
if
"
at
the
time
of
such
operation
there
was
no
entry
into
North
Korea
by
major
Soviet
or
Chinese
Communist
forces
,
no
announcements
of
intended
entry
,
nor
a
threat
to
counter
our
operations
militarily
...
"
On
29
September
MacArthur
restored
the
government
of
the
Republic
of
Korea
under
Syngman
Rhee
.
On
30
September
,
Defense
Secretary
George
Marshall
sent
an
eyes-only
message
to
MacArthur
:
"
We
want
you
to
feel
unhampered
tactically
and
strategically
to
proceed
north
of
the
38th
parallel
.
"
During
October
,
the
ROK
police
executed
people
who
were
suspected
to
be
sympathetic
to
North
Korea
,
and
similar
massacres
were
carried
out
until
early
1951
.
On
30
September
,
Zhou
Enlai
warned
the
United
States
that
China
was
prepared
to
intervene
in
Korea
if
the
United
States
crossed
the
38th
parallel
.
Zhou
attempted
to
advise
North
Korean
commanders
on
how
to
conduct
a
general
withdrawal
by
using
the
same
tactics
which
had
allowed
Chinese
communist
forces
to
successfully
escape
Chiang
Kai-shek
's
Encirclement
Campaigns
in
the
1930s
,
but
by
some
accounts
North
Korean
commanders
did
not
utilize
these
tactics
effectively
.
Historian
Bruce
Cumings
argues
,
however
,
the
KPA
's
rapid
withdrawal
was
strategic
,
with
troops
melting
into
the
mountains
from
where
they
could
launch
guerrilla
raids
on
the
UN
forces
spread
out
on
the
coasts
.
By
1
October
1950
,
the
UN
Command
repelled
the
KPA
northwards
past
the
38th
parallel
;
the
ROK
Army
crossed
after
them
,
into
North
Korea
.
MacArthur
made
a
statement
demanding
the
KPA
's
unconditional
surrender
.
Six
days
later
,
on
7
October
,
with
UN
authorization
,
the
UN
Command
forces
followed
the
ROK
forces
northwards
.
The
X
Corps
landed
at
Wonsan
(
in
southeastern
North
Korea
)
and
Riwon
(
in
northeastern
North
Korea
)
,
already
captured
by
ROK
forces
.
The
Eighth
U.S.
Army
and
the
ROK
Army
drove
up
western
Korea
and
captured
Pyongyang
city
,
the
North
Korean
capital
,
on
19
October
1950
.
The
187th
Airborne
Regimental
Combat
Team
(
"
Rakkasans
"
)
made
their
first
of
two
combat
jumps
during
the
Korean
War
on
20
October
1950
at
Sunchon
and
Sukchon
.
The
missions
of
the
187th
were
to
cut
the
road
north
going
to
China
,
preventing
North
Korean
leaders
from
escaping
from
Pyongyang
;
and
to
rescue
American
prisoners
of
war
.
At
month
's
end
,
UN
forces
held
135,000
KPA
prisoners
of
war
.
As
they
neared
the
Sino-Korean
border
,
the
UN
forces
in
the
west
were
divided
from
those
in
the
east
by
50
–
100
miles
of
mountainous
terrain
.
On
27
June
1950
,
two
days
after
the
KPA
invaded
and
three
months
before
the
Chinese
entered
the
war
,
President
Truman
dispatched
the
United
States
Seventh
Fleet
to
the
Taiwan
Strait
,
to
prevent
hostilities
between
the
Nationalist
Republic
of
China
(
Taiwan
)
and
the
People
's
Republic
of
China
(
PRC
)
.
On
4
August
1950
,
with
the
PRC
invasion
of
Taiwan
aborted
,
Mao
Zedong
reported
to
the
Politburo
that
he
would
intervene
in
Korea
when
the
People
's
Liberation
Army
's
(
PLA
)
Taiwan
invasion
force
was
reorganized
into
the
PLA
North
East
Frontier
Force
.
China
justified
its
entry
into
the
war
as
a
response
to
"
American
aggression
in
the
guise
of
the
UN
"
.
In
a
series
of
emergency
meetings
that
lasted
from
2–5
October
,
Chinese
leaders
debated
whether
to
send
Chinese
troops
into
Korea
.
There
was
considerable
resistance
among
many
leaders
,
including
senior
military
leaders
,
to
confronting
the
U.S.
in
Korea
.
Mao
strongly
supported
intervention
,
and
Zhou
was
one
of
the
few
Chinese
leaders
who
firmly
supported
him
.
After
Lin
Biao
politely
refused
Mao
's
offer
to
command
Chinese
forces
in
Korea
(
citing
his
upcoming
medical
treatment
)
,
Mao
decided
that
Peng
Dehuai
would
be
the
commander
of
the
Chinese
forces
in
Korea
after
Peng
agreed
to
support
Mao
's
position
.
Mao
then
asked
Peng
to
speak
in
favor
of
intervention
to
the
rest
of
the
Chinese
leaders
.
After
Peng
made
the
case
that
if
U.S.
troops
conquered
Korea
and
reached
the
Yalu
they
might
cross
it
and
invade
China
the
Politburo
agreed
to
intervene
in
Korea
.
Later
,
the
Chinese
claimed
that
US
bombers
had
violated
PRC
national
airspace
on
three
separate
occasions
and
attacked
Chinese
targets
before
China
intervened
.
On
8
October
1950
,
Mao
Zedong
redesignated
the
PLA
North
East
Frontier
Force
as
the
Chinese
People
's
Volunteer
Army
(
PVA
)
.
In
order
to
enlist
Stalin
's
support
,
Zhou
and
a
Chinese
delegation
left
for
Moscow
on
8
October
,
arriving
there
on
10
October
at
which
point
they
flew
to
Stalin
's
home
at
the
Black
Sea
.
There
they
conferred
with
the
top
Soviet
leadership
which
included
Joseph
Stalin
as
well
as
Vyacheslav
Molotov
,
Lavrentiy
Beria
and
Georgi
Malenkov
.
Stalin
initially
agreed
to
send
military
equipment
and
ammunition
,
but
warned
Zhou
that
the
Soviet
Union
's
air
force
would
need
two
or
three
months
to
prepare
any
operations
.
In
a
subsequent
meeting
,
Stalin
told
Zhou
that
he
would
only
provide
China
with
equipment
on
a
credit
basis
,
and
that
the
Soviet
air
force
would
only
operate
over
Chinese
airspace
,
and
only
after
an
undisclosed
period
of
time
.
Stalin
did
not
agree
to
send
either
military
equipment
or
air
support
until
March
1951
.
Mao
did
not
find
Soviet
air
support
especially
useful
,
as
the
fighting
was
going
to
take
place
on
the
south
side
of
the
Yalu
.
Soviet
shipments
of
matériel
,
when
they
did
arrive
,
were
limited
to
small
quantities
of
trucks
,
grenades
,
machine
guns
,
and
the
like
.
UN
aerial
reconnaissance
had
difficulty
sighting
PVA
units
in
daytime
,
because
their
march
and
bivouac
discipline
minimized
aerial
detection
.
The
PVA
marched
"
dark
-
to-
dark
"
(
19:00
–
03:00
)
,
and
aerial
camouflage
(
concealing
soldiers
,
pack
animals
,
and
equipment
)
was
deployed
by
05:30
.
Meanwhile
,
daylight
advance
parties
scouted
for
the
next
bivouac
site
.
During
daylight
activity
or
marching
,
soldiers
were
to
remain
motionless
if
an
aircraft
appeared
,
until
it
flew
away
;
PVA
officers
were
under
order
to
shoot
security
violators
.
Such
battlefield
discipline
allowed
a
three
-
division
army
to
march
the
286
miles
(
460
km
)
from
An-tung
,
Manchuria
,
to
the
combat
zone
in
some
19
days
.
Another
division
night-marched
a
circuitous
mountain
route
,
averaging
18
miles
(
29
km
)
daily
for
18
days
.
Meanwhile
,
on
10
October
1950
,
the
89th
Tank
Battalion
was
attached
to
the
1st
Cavalry
Division
,
increasing
the
armor
available
for
the
Northern
Offensive
.
On
15
October
,
after
moderate
KPA
resistance
,
the
7th
Cavalry
Regiment
and
Charlie
Company
,
70th
Tank
Battalion
captured
Namchonjam
city
.
On
17
October
,
they
flanked
rightwards
,
away
from
the
principal
road
(
to
Pyongyang
)
,
to
capture
Hwangju
.
Two
days
later
,
the
1st
Cavalry
Division
captured
Pyongyang
,
the
North
's
capital
city
,
on
19
October
1950
.
Kim
Il
Sung
and
his
government
temporarily
moved
its
capital
to
Sinuiju
–
although
as
UNC
forces
approached
,
the
government
again
moved
–
this
time
to
Kanggye
.
On
15
October
1950
,
President
Truman
and
General
MacArthur
met
at
Wake
Island
in
the
mid-Pacific
Ocean
.
This
meeting
was
much
publicized
because
of
the
General
's
discourteous
refusal
to
meet
the
President
on
the
continental
United
States
.
To
President
Truman
,
MacArthur
speculated
there
was
little
risk
of
Chinese
intervention
in
Korea
,
and
that
the
PRC
's
opportunity
for
aiding
the
KPA
had
lapsed
.
He
believed
the
PRC
had
some
300,000
soldiers
in
Manchuria
,
and
some
100,000
–
125,000
soldiers
at
the
Yalu
River
.
He
further
concluded
that
,
although
half
of
those
forces
might
cross
south
,
"
if
the
Chinese
tried
to
get
down
to
Pyongyang
,
there
would
be
the
greatest
slaughter
"
without
air
force
protection
.
After
secretly
crossing
the
Yalu
River
on
19
October
,
the
PVA
13th
Army
Group
launched
the
First
Phase
Offensive
on
25
October
,
attacking
the
advancing
UN
forces
near
the
Sino-Korean
border
.
This
military
decision
made
solely
by
China
changed
the
attitude
of
the
Soviet
Union
.
Twelve
days
after
Chinese
troops
entered
the
war
,
Stalin
allowed
the
Soviet
Air
Force
to
provide
air
cover
,
and
supported
more
aid
to
China
.
After
decimating
the
ROK
II
Corps
at
the
Battle
of
Onjong
,
the
first
confrontation
between
Chinese
and
U.S.
military
occurred
on
1
November
1950
;
deep
in
North
Korea
,
thousands
of
soldiers
from
the
PVA
39th
Army
encircled
and
attacked
the
U.S.
8th
Cavalry
Regiment
with
three
-
prong
assaults
—
from
the
north
,
northwest
,
and
west
—
and
overran
the
defensive
position
flanks
in
the
Battle
of
Unsan
.
The
surprise
assault
resulted
in
the
UN
forces
retreating
back
to
the
Ch'ongch
'on
River
,
while
the
Chinese
unexpectedly
disappeared
into
mountain
hideouts
following
victory
.
It
is
unclear
why
the
Chinese
did
not
press
the
attack
and
follow
up
their
victory
.
On
25
November
at
the
Korean
western
front
,
the
PVA
13th
Army
Group
attacked
and
overran
the
ROK
II
Corps
at
the
Battle
of
the
Ch'ongch
'on
River
,
and
then
decimated
the
US
2nd
Infantry
Division
on
the
UN
forces
'
right
flank
.
The
UN
Command
retreated
;
the
U.S.
Eighth
Army
's
retreat
(
the
longest
in
US
Army
history
)
was
made
possible
because
of
the
Turkish
Brigade
's
successful
,
but
very
costly
,
rear-guard
delaying
action
near
Kunuri
that
slowed
the
PVA
attack
for
two
days
(
27–29
November
)
.
On
27
November
at
the
Korean
eastern
front
,
a
U.S.
7th
Infantry
Division
Regimental
Combat
Team
(
3,000
soldiers
)
and
the
U.S.
1st
Marine
Division
(
12,000
–
15,000
marines
)
were
unprepared
for
the
PVA
9th
Army
Group
's
three
-
pronged
encirclement
tactics
at
the
Battle
of
Chosin
Reservoir
,
but
they
managed
to
escape
under
Air
Force
and
X
Corps
support
fire
—
albeit
with
some
15,000
collective
casualties
.
By
30
November
,
the
PVA
13th
Army
Group
managed
to
expel
the
U.S.
Eighth
Army
from
northwest
Korea
.
Retreating
from
the
north
faster
than
they
had
counter-invaded
,
the
Eighth
Army
crossed
the
38th
parallel
border
in
mid
December
.
UN
morale
hit
rock
bottom
when
commanding
General
Walton
Walker
of
the
U.S.
Eighth
Army
was
killed
on
23
December
1950
in
an
automobile
accident
.
In
northeast
Korea
by
11
December
,
the
U.S.
X
Corps
managed
to
cripple
the
PVA
9th
Army
Group
while
establishing
a
defensive
perimeter
at
the
port
city
of
Hungnam
.
The
X
Corps
were
forced
to
evacuate
by
24
December
in
order
to
reinforce
the
badly
depleted
U.S.
Eighth
Army
to
the
south
.
During
the
Hungnam
evacuation
,
about
193
shiploads
of
UN
Command
forces
and
matériel
(
approximately
105,000
soldiers
,
98,000
civilians
,
17,500
vehicles
,
and
350,000
tons
of
supplies
)
were
evacuated
to
Pusan
.
The
SS
Meredith
Victory
was
noted
for
evacuating
14,000
refugees
,
the
largest
rescue
operation
by
a
single
ship
,
even
though
it
was
designed
to
hold
12
passengers
.
Before
escaping
,
the
UN
Command
forces
razed
most
of
Hungnam
city
,
especially
the
port
facilities
;
and
on
16
December
1950
,
President
Truman
declared
a
national
emergency
with
Presidential
Proclamation
No.
2914
,
3
C.F.R.
99
(
1953
)
,
which
remained
in
force
until
14
September
1978
.
[
b]
The
next
day
(
17
December
1950
)
Kim
Il-sung
was
deprived
of
the
right
of
command
of
KPA
by
China
.
After
that
,
the
leading
part
of
the
war
became
the
Chinese
army
.
Following
that
,
on
1
February
1951
,
United
Nations
General
Assembly
adopted
a
draft
resolution
condemning
China
as
an
aggressor
in
the
Korean
War
.
With
Lieutenant
-
General
Matthew
Ridgway
assuming
the
command
of
the
U.S.
Eighth
Army
on
26
December
,
the
PVA
and
the
KPA
launched
their
Third
Phase
Offensive
(
also
known
as
the
"
Chinese
New
Year
's
Offensive
"
)
on
New
Year
's
Eve
of
1950
.
Utilizing
night
attacks
in
which
UN
Command
fighting
positions
were
encircled
and
then
assaulted
by
numerically
superior
troops
who
had
the
element
of
surprise
,
the
attacks
were
accompanied
by
loud
trumpets
and
gongs
,
which
fulfilled
the
double
purpose
of
facilitating
tactical
communication
and
mentally
disorienting
the
enemy
.
UN
forces
initially
had
no
familiarity
with
this
tactic
,
and
as
a
result
some
soldiers
panicked
,
abandoning
their
weapons
and
retreating
to
the
south
.
The
Chinese
New
Year
's
Offensive
overwhelmed
UN
forces
,
allowing
the
PVA
and
KPA
to
conquer
Seoul
for
the
second
time
on
4
January
1951
.
UN
forces
retreated
to
Suwon
in
the
west
,
Wonju
in
the
center
,
and
the
territory
north
of
Samcheok
in
the
east
,
where
the
battlefront
stabilized
and
held
.
The
PVA
had
outrun
its
logistics
capability
and
thus
were
unable
to
press
on
beyond
Seoul
as
food
,
ammunition
,
and
matériel
were
carried
nightly
,
on
foot
and
bicycle
,
from
the
border
at
the
Yalu
River
to
the
three
battle
lines
.
In
late
January
,
upon
finding
that
the
PVA
had
abandoned
their
battle
lines
,
General
Ridgway
ordered
a
reconnaissance
-
in-
force
,
which
became
Operation
Roundup
(
5
February
1951
)
.
A
full-scale
X
Corps
advance
proceeded
,
which
fully
exploited
the
UN
Command
's
air
superiority
,
concluding
with
the
UN
reaching
the
Han
River
and
recapturing
Wonju
.
In
early
February
,
the
South
Korean
11th
Division
ran
the
operation
to
destroy
the
guerrillas
and
their
sympathizer
citizens
in
Southern
Korea
.
During
the
operation
,
the
division
and
police
conducted
the
Geochang
massacre
and
Sancheong
-
Hamyang
massacre
.
In
mid-February
,
the
PVA
counterattacked
with
the
Fourth
Phase
Offensive
and
achieved
initial
victory
at
Hoengseong
.
But
the
offensive
was
soon
blunted
by
the
IX
Corps
positions
at
Chipyong
-
ni
in
the
center
.
Units
of
the
U.S.
2nd
Infantry
Division
and
the
French
Battalion
fought
a
short
but
desperate
battle
that
broke
the
attack
's
momentum
.
The
battle
is
sometimes
known
as
the
Gettysburg
of
the
Korean
War
.
The
battle
saw
5,600
Korean
,
American
and
French
troops
defeat
a
numerically
superior
Chinese
force
.
Surrounded
on
all
sides
,
the
U.S.
2nd
Infantry
Division
Warrior
Division
's
23rd
Regimental
Combat
Team
with
an
attached
French
Battalion
was
hemmed
in
by
more
than
25,000
Chinese
Communist
forces
.
United
Nations
forces
had
previously
retreated
in
the
face
of
large
Communist
forces
instead
of
getting
cut
off
,
but
this
time
they
stood
and
fought
at
odds
of
roughly
15
to
1
.
In
the
last
two
weeks
of
February
1951
,
Operation
Roundup
was
followed
by
Operation
Killer
,
carried
out
by
the
revitalized
Eighth
Army
.
It
was
a
full-scale
,
battlefront
-
length
attack
staged
for
maximum
exploitation
of
firepower
to
kill
as
many
KPA
and
PVA
troops
as
possible
.
Operation
Killer
concluded
with
I
Corps
re-occupying
the
territory
south
of
the
Han
River
,
and
IX
Corps
capturing
Hoengseong
.
On
7
March
1951
,
the
Eighth
Army
attacked
with
Operation
Ripper
,
expelling
the
PVA
and
the
KPA
from
Seoul
on
14
March
1951
.
This
was
the
city
's
fourth
conquest
in
a
years
'
time
,
leaving
it
a
ruin
;
the
1.5
million
pre-war
population
was
down
to
200,000
,
and
people
were
suffering
from
severe
food
shortages
.
On
1
March
1951
Mao
sent
a
cable
to
Stalin
,
in
which
he
emphasized
the
difficulties
faced
by
Chinese
forces
and
the
urgent
need
for
air
cover
,
especially
over
supply
lines
.
Apparently
impressed
by
the
Chinese
war
effort
,
Stalin
finally
agreed
to
supply
two
air
force
divisions
,
three
anti-aircraft
divisions
,
and
six
thousand
trucks
.
PVA
troops
in
Korea
continued
to
suffer
severe
logistical
problems
throughout
the
war
.
In
late
April
Peng
Dehuai
sent
his
deputy
,
Hong
Xuezhi
,
to
brief
Zhou
Enlai
in
Beijing
.
What
Chinese
soldiers
feared
,
Hong
said
,
was
not
the
enemy
,
but
that
they
had
nothing
to
eat
,
no
bullets
to
shoot
,
and
no
trucks
to
transport
them
to
the
rear
when
they
were
wounded
.
Zhou
attempted
to
respond
to
the
PVA
's
logistical
concerns
by
increasing
Chinese
production
and
improving
methods
of
supply
,
but
these
efforts
were
never
completely
sufficient
.
At
the
same
time
,
large-scale
air
defense
training
programs
were
carried
out
,
and
the
Chinese
Air
Force
began
to
participate
in
the
war
from
September
1951
onward
.
On
11
April
1951
,
Commander-in-
Chief
Truman
relieved
the
controversial
General
MacArthur
,
the
Supreme
Commander
in
Korea
.
There
were
several
reasons
for
the
dismissal
.
MacArthur
had
crossed
the
38th
parallel
in
the
mistaken
belief
that
the
Chinese
would
not
enter
the
war
,
leading
to
major
allied
losses
.
He
believed
that
whether
or
not
to
use
nuclear
weapons
should
be
his
own
decision
,
not
the
President
's
.
MacArthur
threatened
to
destroy
China
unless
it
surrendered
.
While
MacArthur
felt
total
victory
was
the
only
honorable
outcome
,
Truman
was
more
pessimistic
about
his
chances
once
involved
in
a
land
war
in
Asia
,
and
felt
a
truce
and
orderly
withdrawal
from
Korea
could
be
a
valid
solution
.
MacArthur
was
the
subject
of
congressional
hearings
in
May
and
June
1951
,
which
determined
that
he
had
defied
the
orders
of
the
President
and
thus
had
violated
the
U.S.
Constitution
.
A
popular
criticism
of
MacArthur
was
that
he
never
spent
a
night
in
Korea
,
and
directed
the
war
from
the
safety
of
Tokyo
.
General
Ridgway
was
appointed
Supreme
Commander
,
Korea
;
he
regrouped
the
UN
forces
for
successful
counterattacks
,
while
General
James
Van
Fleet
assumed
command
of
the
U.S.
Eighth
Army
.
Further
attacks
slowly
depleted
the
PVA
and
KPA
forces
;
Operations
Courageous
(
23–
28
March
1951
)
and
Tomahawk
(
23
March
1951
)
were
a
joint
ground
and
airborne
infilltration
meant
to
trap
Chinese
forces
between
Kaesong
and
Seoul
.
UN
forces
advanced
to
"
Line
Kansas
"
,
north
of
the
38th
parallel
.
The
187th
Airborne
Regimental
Combat
Team
's
(
"
Rakkasans
"
)
second
of
two
combat
jumps
was
on
Easter
Sunday
,
1951
,
at
Munsan
-ni
,
South
Korea
,
codenamed
Operation
Tomahawk
.
The
mission
was
to
get
behind
Chinese
forces
and
block
their
movement
north
.
The
60th
Indian
Parachute
Field
Ambulance
provided
the
medical
cover
for
the
operations
,
dropping
an
ADS
and
a
surgical
team
and
treating
over
400
battle
casualties
apart
from
the
civilian
casualties
that
formed
the
core
of
their
objective
as
the
unit
was
on
a
humanitarian
mission
.
The
Chinese
counterattacked
in
April
1951
,
with
the
Fifth
Phase
Offensive
,
also
known
as
the
Chinese
Spring
Offensive
,
with
three
field
armies
(
approximately
700,000
men
)
.
The
offensive
's
first
thrust
fell
upon
I
Corps
,
which
fiercely
resisted
in
the
Battle
of
the
Imjin
River
(
22
–
25
April
1951
)
and
the
Battle
of
Kapyong
(
22
–
25
April
1951
)
,
blunting
the
impetus
of
the
offensive
,
which
was
halted
at
the
"
No
-
name
Line
"
north
of
Seoul
.
On
15
May
1951
,
the
Chinese
commenced
the
second
impulse
of
the
Spring
Offensive
and
attacked
the
ROK
Army
and
the
U.S.
X
Corps
in
the
east
at
the
Soyang
River
.
After
initial
success
,
they
were
halted
by
20
May
.
At
month
's
end
,
the
U.S.
Eighth
Army
counterattacked
and
regained
"
Line
Kansas
"
,
just
north
of
the
38th
parallel
.
The
UN's
"
Line
Kansas
"
halt
and
subsequent
offensive
action
stand
-down
began
the
stalemate
that
lasted
until
the
armistice
of
1953
.
For
the
remainder
of
the
Korean
War
the
UN
Command
and
the
PVA
fought
,
but
exchanged
little
territory
;
the
stalemate
held
.
Large-scale
bombing
of
North
Korea
continued
,
and
protracted
armistice
negotiations
began
10
July
1951
at
Kaesong
.
On
the
Chinese
side
,
Zhou
Enlai
directed
peace
talks
,
and
Li
Kenong
and
Qiao
Guanghua
headed
the
negotiation
team
.
Combat
continued
while
the
belligerents
negotiated
;
the
UN
Command
forces
'
goal
was
to
recapture
all
of
South
Korea
and
to
avoid
losing
territory
.
The
PVA
and
the
KPA
attempted
similar
operations
,
and
later
effected
military
and
psychological
operations
in
order
to
test
the
UN
Command
's
resolve
to
continue
the
war
.
The
principal
battles
of
the
stalemate
include
the
Battle
of
Bloody
Ridge
(
18
August
–
15
September
1951
)
,
the
Battle
of
the
Punchbowl
(
31
August
-
21
September
1951
)
,
the
Battle
of
Heartbreak
Ridge
(
13
September
–
15
October
1951
)
,
the
Battle
of
Old
Baldy
(
26
June
–4
August
1952
)
,
the
Battle
of
White
Horse
(
6–
15
October
1952
)
,
the
Battle
of
Triangle
Hill
(
14
October
–
25
November
1952
)
,
the
Battle
of
Hill
Eerie
(
21
March
–
21
June
1952
)
,
the
sieges
of
Outpost
Harry
(
10
–
18
June
1953
)
,
the
Battle
of
the
Hook
(
28–29
May
1953
)
,
the
Battle
of
Pork
Chop
Hill
(
23
March
–
16
July
1953
)
,
and
the
Battle
of
Kumsong
(
13
–
27
July
1953
)
.
Chinese
troops
suffered
from
deficient
military
equipment
,
serious
logistical
problems
,
overextended
communication
and
supply
lines
,
and
the
constant
threat
of
UN
bombers
.
All
of
these
factors
generally
led
to
a
rate
of
Chinese
casualties
that
was
far
greater
than
the
casualties
suffered
by
UN
troops
.
The
situation
became
so
serious
that
,
on
November
1951
,
Zhou
Enlai
called
a
conference
in
Shenyang
to
discuss
the
PVA
's
logistical
problems
.
At
the
meeting
it
was
decided
to
accelerate
the
construction
of
railways
and
airfields
in
the
area
,
to
increase
the
number
of
trucks
available
to
the
army
,
and
to
improve
air
defense
by
any
means
possible
.
These
commitments
did
little
to
directly
address
the
problems
confronting
PVA
troops
.
In
the
months
after
the
Shenyang
conference
Peng
Dehuai
went
to
Beijing
several
times
to
brief
Mao
and
Zhou
about
the
heavy
casualties
suffered
by
Chinese
troops
and
the
increasing
difficulty
of
keeping
the
front
lines
supplied
with
basic
necessities
.
Peng
was
convinced
that
the
war
would
be
protracted
,
and
that
neither
side
would
be
able
to
achieve
victory
in
the
near
future
.
On
24
February
1952
,
the
Military
Commission
,
presided
over
by
Zhou
,
discussed
the
PVA
's
logistical
problems
with
members
of
various
government
agencies
involved
in
the
war
effort
.
After
the
government
representatives
emphasized
their
inability
to
meet
the
demands
of
the
war
,
Peng
,
in
an
angry
outburst
,
shouted
:
"
You
have
this
and
that
problem
...
You
should
go
to
the
front
and
see
with
your
own
eyes
what
food
and
clothing
the
soldiers
have
!
Not
to
speak
of
the
casualties
!
For
what
are
they
giving
their
lives
?
We
have
no
aircraft
.
We
have
only
a
few
guns
.
Transports
are
not
protected
.
More
and
more
soldiers
are
dying
of
starvation
.
Ca
n't
you
overcome
some
of
your
difficulties
?
"
The
atmosphere
became
so
tense
that
Zhou
was
forced
to
adjourn
the
conference
.
Zhou
subsequently
called
a
series
of
meetings
,
where
it
was
agreed
that
the
PVA
would
be
divided
into
three
groups
,
to
be
dispatched
to
Korea
in
shifts
;
to
accelerate
the
training
of
Chinese
pilots
;
to
provide
more
anti-aircraft
guns
to
the
front
lines
;
to
purchase
more
military
equipment
and
ammunition
from
the
Soviet
Union
;
to
provide
the
army
with
more
food
and
clothing
;
and
,
to
transfer
the
responsibility
of
logistics
to
the
central
government
.
The
on-
again
,
off-again
armistice
negotiations
continued
for
two
years
,
first
at
Kaesong
,
on
the
border
between
North
and
South
Korea
,
and
then
at
the
neighbouring
village
of
Panmunjom
.
A
major
,
problematic
negotiation
point
was
prisoner
of
war
(
POW
)
repatriation
.
The
PVA
,
KPA
,
and
UN
Command
could
not
agree
on
a
system
of
repatriation
because
many
PVA
and
KPA
soldiers
refused
to
be
repatriated
back
to
the
north
,
which
was
unacceptable
to
the
Chinese
and
North
Koreans
.
In
the
final
armistice
agreement
,
signed
on
27
July
1953
,
a
Neutral
Nations
Repatriation
Commission
,
under
the
chairman
Indian
General
K.
S.
Thimayya
,
was
set
up
to
handle
the
matter
.
In
1952
,
the
United
States
elected
a
new
president
,
and
on
29
November
1952
,
the
president-elect
,
Dwight
D.
Eisenhower
,
went
to
Korea
to
learn
what
might
end
the
Korean
War
.
With
the
United
Nations
'
acceptance
of
India
's
proposed
Korean
War
armistice
,
the
KPA
,
the
PVA
,
and
the
UN
Command
ceased
fire
with
the
battle
line
approximately
at
the
38th
parallel
.
Upon
agreeing
to
the
armistice
,
the
belligerents
established
the
Korean
Demilitarized
Zone
(
DMZ
)
,
which
has
since
been
patrolled
by
the
KPA
and
ROKA
,
United
States
,
and
Joint
UN
Commands
.
The
Demilitarized
Zone
runs
northeast
of
the
38th
parallel
;
to
the
south
,
it
travels
west
.
The
old
Korean
capital
city
of
Kaesong
,
site
of
the
armistice
negotiations
,
originally
was
in
pre-war
South
Korea
,
but
now
is
part
of
North
Korea
.
The
United
Nations
Command
,
supported
by
the
United
States
,
the
North
Korean
People
's
Army
,
and
the
Chinese
People
's
Volunteers
,
signed
the
Armistice
Agreement
on
27
July
1953
to
end
the
fighting
.
The
Armistice
also
called
upon
the
governments
of
South
Korea
,
North
Korea
,
China
and
the
United
States
to
participate
in
continued
peace
talks
.
The
war
is
considered
to
have
ended
at
this
point
,
even
though
there
was
no
peace
treaty
.
North
Korea
nevertheless
claims
that
it
won
the
Korean
War
.
After
the
war
,
Operation
Glory
was
conducted
from
July
to
November
1954
,
to
allow
combatant
countries
to
exchange
their
dead
.
The
remains
of
4,167
U.S.
Army
and
U.S.
Marine
Corps
dead
were
exchanged
for
13,528
KPA
and
PVA
dead
,
and
546
civilians
dead
in
UN
prisoner
-
of
-
war
camps
were
delivered
to
the
South
Korean
government
.
After
Operation
Glory
,
416
Korean
War
unknown
soldiers
were
buried
in
the
National
Memorial
Cemetery
of
the
Pacific
(
The
Punchbowl
)
,
on
the
island
of
Oahu
,
Hawaii
.

records
indicate
that
the
PRC
and
the
DPRK
transmitted
1,394
names
,
of
which
858
were
correct
.
From
4,167
containers
of

,
forensic

4,219
individuals
.
Of
these
,
2,944
were
identified
as

,
and
all
but
416
were
identified
by

.
From
1996
to
2006
,
the
DPRK
recovered
220
remains
near
the
Sino-Korean
border
.
After
a
new
wave
of
UN
sanctions
,
on
11
March
2013
,
North
Korea
claimed
that
it
had
invalidated
the
1953
armistice
.
On
13
March
2013
,
North
Korea
confirmed
it
ended
the
1953
Armistice
and
declared
North
Korea
"
is
not
restrained
by
the
North
-
South
declaration
on
non-aggression
"
.
On
30
March
2013
,
North
Korea
stated
that
it
had
entered
a
"
state
of
war
"
with
South
Korea
and
declared
that
"
The
long-standing
situation
of
the
Korean
peninsula
being
neither
at
peace
nor
at
war
is
finally
over
"
.
Speaking
on
4
April
2013
,
the
U.S.
Secretary
of
Defense
,
Chuck
Hagel
,
informed
the
press
that
Pyongyang
had
"
formally
informed
"
the
Pentagon
that
it
had
"
ratified
"
the
potential
usage
of
a
nuclear
weapon
against
South
Korea
,
Japan
and
the
United
States
of
America
,
including
Guam
and
Hawaii
.
Hagel
also
stated
that
the
United
States
would
deploy
the
Terminal
High
Altitude
Area
Defense
anti-ballistic
missile
system
to
Guam
,
because
of
a
credible
and
realistic
nuclear
threat
from
North
Korea
.
The
initial
assault
by
North
Korean
KPA
forces
were
aided
by
the
use
of
Soviet
T-34
-
85
tanks
.
A
North
Korean
tank
corps
equipped
with
about
120
T-34s
spearheaded
the
invasion
.
These
drove
against
a
ROK
Army
with
few
anti-tank
weapons
adequate
to
deal
with
the
Soviet
T-34s
.
Additional
Soviet
armor
was
added
as
the
offensive
progressed
.
The
North
Korean
tanks
had
a
good
deal
of
early
successes
against
South
Korean
infantry
,
elements
of
the
24th
Infantry
Division
,
and
those
United
States
built
M24
Chaffee
light
tanks
that
they
encountered
.
Interdiction
by
ground
attack
aircraft
was
the
only
means
of
slowing
the
advancing
Korean
armor
.
The
tide
turned
in
favour
of
the
United
Nations
forces
in
August
1950
when
the
North
Koreans
suffered
major
tank
losses
during
a
series
of
battles
in
which
the
UN
forces
brought
heavier
equipment
to
bear
,
including
M4A3
Sherman
medium
tanks
backed
by
U.S.
M26
heavy
tanks
,
along
with
the
British
Centurion
,
Churchill
,
and
Cromwell
tanks
.
Because
neither
Korea
had
a
significant
navy
,
the
Korean
War
featured
few
naval
battles
.
A
skirmish
between
North
Korea
and
the
UN
Command
occurred
on
2
July
1950
;
the
U.S.
Navy
cruiser
USS
Juneau
,
the
Royal
Navy
cruiser
HMS
Jamaica
,
and
the
frigate
HMS
Black
Swan
fought
four
North
Korean
torpedo
boats
and
two
mortar
gunboats
,
and
sank
them
.
USS
Juneau
later
sank
several
ammunition
ships
that
had
been
present
.
The
last
sea
battle
of
the
Korean
War
occurred
at
Inchon
,
days
before
the
Battle
of
Incheon
;
the
ROK
ship
PC
-
703
sank
a
North
Korean
mine
layer
in
the
Battle
of
Haeju
Island
,
near
Inchon
.
Three
other
supply
ships
were
sunk
by
PC
-
703
two
days
later
in
the
Yellow
Sea
.
Thereafter
,
vessels
from
the
UN
nations
held
undisputed
control
of
the
sea
about
Korea
.
The
gun
ships
were
used
in
shore
bombardment
,
while
the
aircraft
carriers
provided
air
support
to
the
ground
forces
.
During
most
of
the
war
,
the
UN
navies
patrolled
the
west
and
east
coasts
of
North
Korea
,
sinking
supply
and
ammunition
ships
and
denying
the
North
Koreans
the
ability
to
resupply
from
the
sea
.
Aside
from
very
occasional
gunfire
from
North
Korean
shore
batteries
,
the
main
threat
to
United
States
and
UN
navy
ships
was
from
magnetic
mines
.
During
the
war
,
five
U.S.
Navy
ships
were
lost
to
mines
:
two
minesweepers
,
two
minesweeper
escorts
,
and
one
ocean
tug
.
Mines
and
gunfire
from
North
Korean
coastal
artillery
damaged
another
87
U.S.
warships
,
resulting
in
slight
to
moderate
damage
.
The
Chinese
intervention
in
late
October
1950
bolstered
the
Korean
People
's
Air
Force
(
KPAF
)
of
North
Korea
with
the
MiG
-
15
,
one
of
the
world
's
most
advanced
jet
fighters
.
The
fast
,
heavily
armed
MiG
outflew
first-
generation
UN
jets
such
as
the
F-80
(
United
States
Air
Force
)
and
Gloster
Meteors
(
Royal
Australian
Air
Force
)
,
posing
a
real
threat
to
B-29
Superfortress
bombers
even
under
fighter
escort
.
Fearful
of
confronting
the
United
States
directly
,
the
Soviet
Union
denied
involvement
of
their
personnel
in
anything
other
than
an
advisory
role
,
but
air
combat
quickly
resulted
in
Soviet
pilots
dropping
their
code
signals
and
speaking
over
the
wireless
in
Russian
.
This
known
direct
Soviet
participation
was
a
casus
belli
that
the
UN
Command
deliberately
overlooked
,
lest
the
war
for
the
Korean
peninsula
expand
to
include
the
Soviet
Union
,
and
potentially
escalate
into
atomic
warfare
.
The
USAF
countered
the
MiG
-
15
by
sending
over
three
squadrons
of
its
most
capable
fighter
,
the
F-86
Sabre
.
These
arrived
in
December
1950
.
The
MiG
was
designed
as
a
bomber
interceptor
.
It
had
a
very
high
service
ceiling
—
50,000
feet
(
15,000
m
)
and
carried
very
heavy
weaponry
:
one
37
mm
cannon
and
two
23
mm
cannons
.
They
were
fast
enough
to
dive
past
the
fighter
escort
of
P-80
Shooting
Stars
and
F9F
Panthers
and
could
reach
and
destroy
the
U.S.
heavy
bombers
.
B-29
losses
could
not
be
avoided
,
and
the
Air
Force
was
forced
to
switch
from
a
daylight
bombing
campaign
to
the
necessarily
less
accurate
nighttime
bombing
of
targets
.
The
MiGs
were
countered
by
the
F-86
Sabres
.
They
had
a
ceiling
of
42,000
feet
(
13,000
m
)
and
were
armed
with
six
.50
caliber
(
12.7
mm
)
machine
guns
,
which
were
range
adjusted
by
radar
gunsights
.
If
coming
in
at
higher
altitude
the
advantage
of
engaging
or
not
went
to
the
MiG
.
Once
in
a
level
flight
dogfight
,
both
swept-wing
designs
attained
comparable
maximum
speeds
of
around
660
mph
(
1,100
km
/h
)
.
The
MiG
climbed
faster
,
but
the
Sabre
turned
and
dived
better
.

Most
of

's
fictional
characters
operate
in
a
single
reality
known
as
the
Marvel
Universe
,
with
locations
that
mirror
real-life
cities
.
Characters
such
as
Spider-Man
,
the
Fantastic
Four
,
the
Avengers
,
Daredevil
and
Doctor
Strange
are
based
in

have
historically

Martin
Goodman
founded
the
company
later
known
as
Marvel
Comics
under
the
name
Timely
Publications
in
1939
.
Martin
Goodman
,
a
pulp
magazine
publisher
who
had
started
with
a
Western
pulp
in
1933
,
was
expanding
into
the
emerging
—
and
by
then
already
highly
popular
—
new
medium
of
comic
books
.
Launching
his
new
line
from
his
existing
company
's
offices
at
330
West
42nd
Street
,
New
York
City
,
he
officially
held
the
titles
of
editor
,
managing
editor
,
and
business
manager
,
with
Abraham
Goodman
officially
listed
as
publisher
.
Timely
's
first
publication
,
Marvel
Comics
#
1
(
cover
dated
Oct.
1939
)
,
included
the
first
appearance
of
Carl
Burgos
'
android
superhero
the
Human
Torch
,
and
the
first
appearances
of
Bill
Everett
's
anti-hero
Namor
the
Sub-Mariner
,
among
other
features
.
The
issue
was
a
great
success
,
with
it
and
a
second
printing
the
following
month
selling
,
combined
,
nearly
900,000
copies
.
While
its
contents
came
from
an
outside
packager
,
Funnies
,
Inc.
,
Timely
had
its
own
staff
in
place
by
the
following
year
.
The
company
's
first
true
editor
,
writer
-
artist
Joe
Simon
,
teamed
with
artist
and
emerging
industry
notable
Jack
Kirby
to
create
one
of
the
first
patriotically
themed
superheroes
,
Captain
America
,
in
Captain
America
Comics
#
1
(
March
1941
)
.
It
,
too
,
proved
a
hit
,
with
sales
of
nearly
one
million
.
Goodman
formed
Timely
Comics
,
Inc.
,
beginning
with
comics
cover-dated
April
1941
or
Spring
1941
.
While
no
other
Timely
character
would
achieve
the
success
of
these
"
big
three
"
,
some
notable
heroes
—
many
of
which
continue
to
appear
in
modern
-
day
retcon
appearances
and
flashbacks
—
include
the
Whizzer
,
Miss
America
,
the
Destroyer
,
the
original
Vision
,
and
the
Angel
.
Timely
also
published
one
of
humor
cartoonist
Basil
Wolverton
's
best-known
features
,
"
Powerhouse
Pepper
"
,
as
well
as
a
line
of
children
's
funny
-animal
comics
featuring
popular
characters
like
Super
Rabbit
and
the
duo
Ziggy
Pig
and
Silly
Seal
.
Goodman
's
business
strategy
involved
having
his
various
magazines
and
comic
books
published
by
a
number
of
corporations
all
operating
out
of
the
same
office
and
with
the
same
staff
.
One
of
these
shell
companies
through
which
Timely
Comics
was
published
was
named
Marvel
Comics
by
at
least
Marvel
Mystery
Comics
#
55
(
May
1944
)
.
As
well
,
some
comics
'
covers
,
such
as
All
Surprise
Comics
#
12
(
Winter
1946–47
)
,
were
labeled
"
A
Marvel
Magazine
"
many
years
before
Goodman
would
formally
adopt
the
name
in
1961
.
Atlas
,
rather
than
innovate
,
took
a
proven
route
of
following
popular
trends
in
television
and
movies
—
Westerns
and
war
dramas
prevailing
for
a
time
,
drive
-
in
movie
monsters
another
time
—
and
even
other
comic
books
,
particularly
the
EC
horror
line
.
Atlas
also
published
a
plethora
of
children
's
and
teen
humor
titles
,
including
Dan
DeCarlo
's
Homer
the
Happy
Ghost
(
à
la
Casper
the
Friendly
Ghost
)
and
Homer
Hooper
(
à
la
Archie
Andrews
)
.
Atlas
unsuccessfully
attempted
to
revive
superheroes
from
late
1953
to
mid
-1954
,
with
the
Human
Torch
(
art
by
Syd
Shores
and
Dick
Ayers
,
variously
)
,
the
Sub-Mariner
(
drawn
and
most
stories
written
by
Bill
Everett
)
,
and
Captain
America
(
writer
Stan
Lee
,
artist
John
Romita
Sr.
)
.
Atlas
did
not
achieve
any
breakout
hits
and
,
according
to
Stan
Lee
,
Atlas
survived
chiefly
because
it
produced
work
quickly
,
cheaply
,
and
at
a
passable
quality
.
In
1961
,
writer-editor
Stan
Lee
revolutionized
superhero
comics
by
introducing
superheroes
designed
to
appeal
to
more
all
-
ages
readers
than
the
predominantly
child
audiences
of
the
medium
.
Modern
Marvel
's
first
superhero
team
,
the
titular
stars
of
The
Fantastic
Four
#
1
(
Nov.
1961
)
,
broke
convention
with
other
comic
book
archetypes
of
the
time
by
squabbling
,
holding
grudges
both
deep
and
petty
,
and
eschewing
anonymity
or
secret
identities
in
favor
of
celebrity
status
.
Subsequently
,
Marvel
comics
developed
a
reputation
for
focusing
on
characterization
and
adult
issues
to
a
greater
extent
than
most
superhero
comics
before
them
,
a
quality
which
the
new
generation
of
older
readers
appreciated
.
This
applied
to
The
Amazing
Spider
-
Man
title
in
particular
,
which
turned
out
to
be
Marvel
's
most
successful
book
.
Its
young
hero
suffered
from
self
-doubt
and
mundane
problems
like
any
other
teenager
,
something
readers
could
identify
with
.
Lee
and
freelance
artist
and
eventual
co-plotter
Jack
Kirby
's
Fantastic
Four
originated
in
a
Cold
War
culture
that
led
their
creators
to
revise
the
superhero
conventions
of
previous
eras
to
better
reflect
the
psychological
spirit
of
their
age
.
Eschewing
such
comic-book
tropes
as
secret
identities
and
even
costumes
at
first
,
having
a
monster
as
one
of
the
heroes
,
and
having
its
characters
bicker
and
complain
in
what
was
later
called
a
"
superheroes
in
the
real
world
"
approach
,
the
series
represented
a
change
that
proved
to
be
a
great
success
.
All
of
these
elements
struck
a
chord
with
the
older
readers
,
such
as
college
-
aged
adults
,
and
they
successfully
gained
in
a
way
not
seen
before
.
In
1965
,
Spider-Man
and
the
Hulk
were
both
featured
in
Esquire
magazine
's
list
of
28
college
campus
heroes
,
alongside
John
F.
Kennedy
and
Bob
Dylan
.
In
2009
writer
Geoff
Boucher
reflected
that
,
"
Superman
and
DC
Comics
instantly
seemed
like
boring
old
Pat
Boone
;
Marvel
felt
like
The
Beatles
and
the
British
Invasion
.
It
was
Kirby
's
artwork
with
its
tension
and
psychedelia
that
made
it
perfect
for
the
times
—
or
was
it
Lee
's
bravado
and
melodrama
,
which
was
somehow
insecure
and
brash
at
the
same
time
?
"
In
addition
to
Spider-Man
and
the
Fantastic
Four
,
Marvel
began
publishing
further
superhero
titles
featuring
such
heroes
and
antiheroes
as
the
Hulk
,
Thor
,
Ant-Man
,
Iron
Man
,
the
X-Men
,
Daredevil
,
the
Inhumans
,
Black
Panther
,
Doctor
Strange
,
Captain
Marvel
and
the
Silver
Surfer
,
and
such
memorable
antagonists
as
Doctor
Doom
,
Magneto
,
Galactus
,
Loki
,
the
Green
Goblin
,
and
Doctor
Octopus
,
all
existing
in
a
shared
reality
known
as
the
Marvel
Universe
,
with
locations
that
mirror
real-
life
cities
such
as
New
York
,
Los
Angeles
and
Chicago
.
In
1968
,
while
selling
50
million
comic
books
a
year
,
company
founder
Goodman
revised
the
constraining
distribution
arrangement
with
Independent
News
he
had
reached
under
duress
during
the
Atlas
years
,
allowing
him
now
to
release
as
many
titles
as
demand
warranted
.
Late
that
year
he
sold
Marvel
Comics
and
his
other
publishing
businesses
to
the
Perfect
Film
and
Chemical
Corporation
,
which
continued
to
group
them
as
the
subsidiary
Magazine
Management
Company
,
with
Goodman
remaining
as
publisher
.
In
1969
,
Goodman
finally
ended
his
distribution
deal
with
Independent
by
signing
with
Curtis
Circulation
Company
.
In
1971
,
the
United
States
Department
of
Health
,
Education
,
and
Welfare
approached
Marvel
Comics
editor-in-
chief
Stan
Lee
to
do
a
comic
book
story
about
drug
abuse
.
Lee
agreed
and
wrote
a
three
-
part
Spider
-
Man
story
portraying
drug
use
as
dangerous
and
unglamorous
.
However
,
the
industry
's
self-censorship
board
,
the
Comics
Code
Authority
,
refused
to
approve
the
story
because
of
the
presence
of
narcotics
,
deeming
the
context
of
the
story
irrelevant
.
Lee
,
with
Goodman
's
approval
,
published
the
story
regardless
in
The
Amazing
Spider
-
Man
#
96–98
(
May
–July
1971
)
,
without
the
Comics
Code
seal
.
The
market
reacted
well
to
the
storyline
,
and
the
CCA
subsequently
revised
the
Code
the
same
year
.
A
series
of
new
editors
-
in-
chief
oversaw
the
company
during
another
slow
time
for
the
industry
.
Once
again
,
Marvel
attempted
to
diversify
,
and
with
the
updating
of
the
Comics
Code
achieved
moderate
to
strong
success
with
titles
themed
to
horror
(
The
Tomb
of
Dracula
)
,
martial
arts
,
(
Shang
-
Chi
:
Master
of
Kung
Fu
)
,
sword
-
and
-
sorcery
(
Conan
the
Barbarian
,
Red
Sonja
)
,
satire
(
Howard
the
Duck
)
and
science
fiction
(
2001
:
A
Space
Odyssey
,
"
Killraven
"
in
Amazing
Adventures
,
Battlestar
Galactica
,
Star
Trek
,
and
,
late
in
the
decade
,
the
long-
running
Star
Wars
series
)
.
Some
of
these
were
published
in
larger
-format
black
and
white
magazines
,
under
its
Curtis
Magazines
imprint
.
Marvel
was
able
to
capitalize
on
its
successful
superhero
comics
of
the
previous
decade
by
acquiring
a
new
newsstand
distributor
and
greatly
expanding
its
comics
line
.
Marvel
pulled
ahead
of
rival
DC
Comics
in
1972
,
during
a
time
when
the
price
and
format
of
the
standard
newsstand
comic
were
in
flux
.
Goodman
increased
the
price
and
size
of
Marvel
's
November
1971
cover-dated
comics
from
15
cents
for
36
pages
total
to
25
cents
for
52
pages
.
DC
followed
suit
,
but
Marvel
the
following
month
dropped
its
comics
to
20
cents
for
36
pages
,
offering
a
lower
-
priced
product
with
a
higher
distributor
discount
.
Goodman
,
now
disconnected
from
Marvel
,
set
up
a
new
company
called
Seaboard
Periodicals
in
1974
,
reviving
Marvel
's
old
Atlas
name
for
a
new
Atlas
Comics
line
,
but
this
lasted
only
a
year
and
a
half
.
In
the
mid-1970s
a
decline
of
the
newsstand
distribution
network
affected
Marvel
.
Cult
hits
such
as
Howard
the
Duck
fell
victim
to
the
distribution
problems
,
with
some
titles
reporting
low
sales
when
in
fact
the
first
specialty
comic
book
stores
resold
them
at
a
later
date
.

But
by
the
end
of
the
decade
,
Marvel
's
fortunes
were
reviving
,
thanks
to
the
rise
of
direct
market
distribution
—
selling
through
those
same
comics
-specialty
stores
instead
of
newsstands
.
Marvel
held
its
own
comic
book
convention
,
Marvelcon
'
75
,
in
spring
1975
,
and
promised
a
Marvelcon
'
76
.
At
the
1975
event
,
Stan
Lee
used
a
Fantastic
Four
panel
discussion
to
announce
that
Jack
Kirby
,
the
artist
co-creator
of
most
of
Marvel
's
signature
characters
,
was
returning
to
Marvel
after
having
left
in
1970
to
work
for
rival
DC
Comics
.
In
October
1976
,
Marvel
,
which
already
licensed
reprints
in
different
countries
,
including
the
UK
,
created
a
superhero
specifically
for
the
British
market
.
Captain
Britain
debuted
exclusively
in
the
UK
,
and
later
appeared
in
American
comics
.
In
1978
,
Jim
Shooter
became
Marvel
's
editor-in-
chief
.
Although
a
controversial
personality
,
Shooter
cured
many
of
the
procedural
ills
at
Marvel
,
including
repeatedly
missed
deadlines
.
During
Shooter
's
nine
-
year
tenure
as
editor-in-chief
,
Chris
Claremont
and
John
Byrne
's
run
on
the
Uncanny
X-
Men
and
Frank
Miller
's
run
on
Daredevil
became
critical
and
commercial
successes
.
Shooter
brought
Marvel
into
the
rapidly
evolving
direct
market
,
institutionalized
creator
royalties
,
starting
with
the
Epic
Comics
imprint
for
creator-owned
material
in
1982
;
introduced
company
-
wide
crossover
story
arcs
with
Contest
of
Champions
and
Secret
Wars
;
and
in
1986
launched
the
ultimately
unsuccessful
New
Universe
line
to
commemorate
the
25th
anniversary
of
the
Marvel
Comics
imprint
.
Star
Comics
,
a
children-oriented
line
differing
from
the
regular
Marvel
titles
,
was
briefly
successful
during
this
period
.
Marvel
earned
a
great
deal
of
money
and
recognition
during
the
comic
book
boom
of
the
early
1990s
,
launching
the
successful
2099
line
of
comics
set
in
the
future
(
Spider
-
Man
2099
,
etc.
)
and
the
creatively
daring
though
commercially
unsuccessful
Razorline
imprint
of
superhero
comics
created
by
novelist
and
filmmaker
Clive
Barker
.
In
1990
,
Marvel
began
selling
Marvel
Universe
Cards
with
trading
card
maker
SkyBox
International
.
These
were
collectible
trading
cards
that
featured
the
characters
and
events
of
the
Marvel
Universe
.
The
1990s
saw
the
rise
of
variant
covers
,
cover
enhancements
,
swimsuit
issues
,
and
company
-
wide
crossovers
that
affected
the
overall
continuity
of
the
fictional
Marvel
Universe
In
1996
,
Marvel
had
some
of
its
titles
participate
in
"
Heroes
Reborn
"
,
a
crossover
that
allowed
Marvel
to
relaunch
some
of
its
flagship
characters
such
as
the
Avengers
and
the
Fantastic
Four
,
and
outsource
them
to
the
studios
of
two
of
the
former
Marvel
artists
turned
Image
Comics
founders
,
Jim
Lee
and
Rob
Liefeld
.
The
relaunched
titles
,
which
saw
the
characters
transported
to
a
parallel
universe
with
a
history
distinct
from
the
mainstream
Marvel
Universe
,
were
a
solid
success
amidst
a
generally
struggling
industry
,
but
Marvel
discontinued
the
experiment
after
a
one
-year
run
and
returned
the
characters
to
the
Marvel
Universe
proper
.
In
1998
,
the
company
launched
the
imprint
Marvel
Knights
,
taking
place
within
Marvel
continuity
;
helmed
by
soon-to-
become
editor-in-
chief
Joe
Quesada
,
it
featured
tough
,
gritty
stories
showcasing
such
characters
as
the
Inhumans
,
Black
Panther
and
Daredevil
.
In
late
1994
,
Marvel
acquired
the
comic
book
distributor
Heroes
World
Distribution
to
use
as
its
own
exclusive
distributor
.
As
the
industry
's
other
major
publishers
made
exclusive
distribution
deals
with
other
companies
,
the
ripple
effect
resulted
in
the
survival
of
only
one
other
major
distributor
in
North
America
,
Diamond
Comic
Distributors
Inc
.
In
early
1997
,
when
Marvel
's
Heroes
World
endeavor
failed
,
Diamond
also
forged
an
exclusive
deal
with
Marvel
—
giving
the
company
its
own
section
of
its
comics
catalog
Previews
.
With
the
new
millennium
,
Marvel
Comics
emerged
from
bankruptcy
and
again
began
diversifying
its
offerings
.
In
2001
,
Marvel
withdrew
from
the
Comics
Code
Authority
and
established
its
own
Marvel
Rating
System
for
comics
.
The
first
title
from
this
era
to
not
have
the
code
was
X
-
Force
#
119
(
October
2001
)
.
Marvel
also
created
new
imprints
,
such
as
MAX
(
an
explicit-content
line
)
and
Marvel
Adventures
(
developed
for
child
audiences
)
.
In
addition
,
the
company
created
an
alternate
universe
imprint
,
Ultimate
Marvel
,
that
allowed
the
company
to
reboot
its
major
titles
by
revising
and
updating
its
characters
to
introduce
to
a
new
generation
.
On
August
31
,
2009
,
The
Walt
Disney
Company
announced
a
deal
to
acquire
Marvel
Comics
'
parent
corporation
,
Marvel
Entertainment
,
for
$
4
billion
or
$
4.2
billion
,
with
Marvel
shareholders
to
receive
$
30
and
0.745
Disney
shares
for
each
share
of
Marvel
they
own
.
As
of
2008
,
Marvel
and
its
major
,
longtime
competitor
DC
Comics
shared
over
80
%
of
the
American
comic-book
market
.
As
of
September
2010
,
Marvel
switched
its
bookstores
distribution
company
from
Diamond
Book
Distributors
to
Hachette
Distribution
Services
.
Marvel
discontinued
its
Marvel
Adventures
imprint
in
March
2012
,
and
replaced
them
with
a
line
of
two
titles
connected
to
the
Marvel
Universe
TV
block
.
Also
in
March
,
Marvel
announced
its
Marvel
ReEvolution
initiative
that
included
Infinite
Comics
,
a
line
of
digital
comics
,
Marvel
AR
,
an
application
software
that
provides
an
augmented
reality
experience
to
readers
and
Marvel
NOW
!
,
a
relaunch
of
most
of
the
company
's
major
titles
with
different
creative
teams
.
Marvel
NOW
!
also
saw
the
debut
of
new
flagship
titles
including
Uncanny
Avengers
and
All
-
New
X
-
Men
.
In
April
2013
,
Marvel
and
other
Disney
conglomerate
components
began
announcing
joint
projects
.
With
ABC
,
a
Once
Upon
a
Time
graphic
novel
was
announced
for
publication
in
September
.
With
Disney
,
Marvel
announced
in
October
2013
that
in
January
2014
it
would
release
its
first
title
under
their
joint
"
Disney
Kingdoms
"
imprint
"
Seekers
of
the
Weird
"
,
a
five-issue
miniseries
.
On
January
3
,
2014
,
fellow
Disney
subsidiary
Lucasfilm
Limited
,
LLC
announced
that
as
of
2015
,
Star
Wars
comics
would
once
again
be
published
by
Marvel
.
Marvel
first
licensed
two
prose
novels
to
Bantam
Books
,
who
printed
The
Avengers
Battle
the
Earth
Wrecker
by
Otto
Binder
(
1967
)
and
Captain
America
:
The
Great
Gold
Steal
by
Ted
White
(
1968
)
.
Various
publishers
took
up
the
licenses
from
1978
to
2002
.
Also
,
with
the
various
licensed
films
being
released
beginning
in
1997
,
various
publishers
put
out
movie
novelizations
.
In
2003
,
following
publication
of
the
prose
young
adult
novel
Mary
Jane
,
starring
Mary
Jane
Watson
from
the
Spider
-
Man
mythos
,
Marvel
announced
the
formation
of
the
publishing
imprint
Marvel
Press
.
However
,
Marvel
moved
back
to
licensing
with
Pocket
Books
from
2005
to
2008
.
With
few
books
issued
under
the
imprint
,
Marvel
and
Disney
Books
Group
relaunched
Marvel
Press
in
2011
with
the
Marvel
Origin
Storybooks
line
.
Walt
Disney
Parks
and
Resorts
plans
on
creating
original
Marvel
attractions
at
their
theme
parks
,
with
Hong
Kong
Disneyland
becoming
the
first
Disney
theme
park
to
feature
a
Marvel
attraction
.
Due
to
the
licensing
agreement
with
Universal
Studios
,
signed
prior
to
Disney
's
purchase
of
Marvel
,
Walt
Disney
World
and
Tokyo
Disney
are
barred
from
having
Marvel
characters
in
their
parks
.
However
,
this
only
includes
characters
Universal
is
currently
using
,
other
characters
in
their
"
families
"
(
X-
Men
,
Avengers
,
Fantastic
Four
,
etc.
)
,
and
the
villains
associated
with
said
characters
.
This
clause
has
allowed
Walt
Disney
World
to
have
meet
and
greets
,
merchandise
,
attractions
and
more
with
other
Marvel
characters
not
associated
with
the
characters
at
Islands
of
Adventures
,
such
as
Star-Lord
and
Gamora
from
Guardians
of
the
Galaxy
as
well
as
Baymax
and
Hiro
from
Big

.
Botany
,
also
called
plant
science
(
s
)
or
plant
biology
,
is
the
science
of
plant
life
and
a
branch
of
biology
.
A
botanist
or
plant
scientist
is
a
scientist
who
specializes
in
this
field
.
The
term
"
botany
"
comes
from
the
Ancient
Greek
word
βοτ
ά
νη
(
botanē
)
meaning
"
pasture
"
,
"
grass
"
,
or
"
fodder
"
;
β
οτά
νη
is
in
turn
derived
from
βόσκει
ν
(
boskein
)
,
"
to
feed
"
or
"
to
graze
"
.
Traditionally
,
botany
has
also
included
the
study
of
fungi
and
algae
by
mycologists
and
phycologists
respectively
,
with
the
study
of
these
three
groups
of
organisms
remaining
within
the
sphere
of
interest
of
the
International
Botanical
Congress
.
Nowadays
,
botanists
study
approximately
400,000
species
of
living
organisms
of
which
some
260,000
species
are
vascular
plants
and
about
248,000
are
flowering
plants
.
Botany
originated
in
prehistory
as
herbalism
with
the
efforts
of
early
humans
to
identify
–
and
later
cultivate
–
edible
,
medicinal
and
poisonous
plants
,
making
it
one
of
the
oldest
branches
of
science
.
Medieval
physic
gardens
,
often
attached
to
monasteries
,
contained
plants
of
medical
importance
.
They
were
forerunners
of
the
first
botanical
gardens
attached
to
universities
,
founded
from
the
1540s
onwards
.
One
of
the
earliest
was
the
Padua
botanical
garden
.
These
gardens
facilitated
the
academic
study
of
plants
.
Efforts
to
catalogue
and
describe
their
collections
were
the
beginnings
of
plant
taxonomy
,
and
led
in
1753
to
the
binomial
system
of
Carl
Linnaeus
that
remains
in
use
to
this
day
.
Modern
botany
is
a
broad
,
multidisciplinary
subject
with
inputs
from
most
other
areas
of
science
and
technology
.
Research
topics
include
the
study
of
plant
structure
,
growth
and
differentiation
,
reproduction
,
biochemistry
and
primary
metabolism
,
chemical
products
,
development
,
diseases
,
evolutionary
relationships
,
systematics
,
and
plant
taxonomy
.
Dominant
themes
in
21st
century
plant
science
are
molecular
genetics
and
epigenetics
,
which
are
the
mechanisms
and
control
of
gene
expression
during
differentiation
of
plant
cells
and
tissues
.
Botanical
research
has
diverse
applications
in
providing
staple
foods
,
materials
such
as
timber
,
oil
,
rubber
,
fibre
and
drugs
,
in
modern
horticulture
,
agriculture
and
forestry
,
plant
propagation
,
breeding
and
genetic
modification
,
in
the
synthesis
of
chemicals
and
raw
materials
for
construction
and
energy
production
,
in
environmental
management
,
and
the
maintenance
of
biodiversity
.
Another
work
from
Ancient
Greece
that
made
an
early
impact
on
botany
is
De
Materia
Medica
,
a
five-volume
encyclopedia
about
herbal
medicine
written
in
the
middle
of
the
first
century
by
Greek
physician
and
pharmacologist
Pedanius
Dioscorides
.
De
Materia
Medica
was
widely
read
for
more
than
1,500
years
.
Important
contributions
from
the
medieval
Muslim
world
include
Ibn
Wahshiyya's
Nabatean
Agriculture
,
Abū
Ḥanīfa
Dīnawarī
's
(
828
–
896
)
the
Book
of
Plants
,
and
Ibn
Bassal
's
The
Classification
of
Soils
.
In
the
early
13th
century
,
Abu
al
-
Abbas
al
-
Nabati
,
and
Ibn
al-Baitar
(
d.
1248
)
wrote
on
botany
in
a
systematic
and
scientific
manner
.
In
the
mid-16th
century
,
"
botanical
gardens
"
were
founded
in
a
number
of
Italian
universities
–
the
Padua
botanical
garden
in
1545
is
usually
considered
to
be
the
first
which
is
still
in
its
original
location
.
These
gardens
continued
the
practical
value
of
earlier
"
physic
gardens
"
,
often
associated
with
monasteries
,
in
which
plants
were
cultivated
for
medical
use
.
They
supported
the
growth
of
botany
as
an
academic
subject
.
Lectures
were
given
about
the
plants
grown
in
the
gardens
and
their
medical
uses
demonstrated
.
Botanical
gardens
came
much
later
to
northern
Europe
;
the
first
in
England
was
the
University
of
Oxford
Botanic
Garden
in
1621
.
Throughout
this
period
,
botany
remained
firmly
subordinate
to
medicine
.
Physician
Valerius
Cordus
(
1515
–
1544
)
authored
a
botanically
and
pharmacologically
important
herbal
Historia
Plantarum
in
1544
and
a
pharmacopoeia
of
lasting
importance
,
the
Dispensatorium
in
1546
.
Naturalist
Conrad
von
Gesner
(
1516
–
1565
)
and
herbalist
John
Gerard
(
1545–c.
1611
)
published
herbals
covering
the
medicinal
uses
of
plants
.
Naturalist
Ulisse
Aldrovandi
(
1522–1605
)
was
considered
the
father
of
natural
history
,
which
included
the
study
of
plants
.
In
1665
,
using
an
early
microscope
,
Polymath
Robert
Hooke
discovered
cells
,
a
term
he
coined
,
in
cork
,
and
a
short
time
later
in
living
plant
tissue
.
During
the
18th
century
,
systems
of
plant
identification
were
developed
comparable
to
dichotomous
keys
,
where
unidentified
plants
are
placed
into
taxonomic
groups
(
e.g.
family
,
genus
and
species
)
by
making
a
series
of
choices
between
pairs
of
characters
.
The
choice
and
sequence
of
the
characters
may
be
artificial
in
keys
designed
purely
for
identification
(
diagnostic
keys
)
or
more
closely
related
to
the
natural
or
phyletic
order
of
the
taxa
in
synoptic
keys
.
By
the
18th
century
,
new
plants
for
study
were
arriving
in
Europe
in
increasing
numbers
from
newly
discovered
countries
and
the
European
colonies
worldwide
.
In
1753
Carl
von
Linné
(
Carl
Linnaeus
)
published
his
Species
Plantarum
,
a
hierarchical
classification
of
plant
species
that
remains
the
reference
point
for
modern
botanical
nomenclature
.
This
established
a
standardised
binomial
or
two
-
part
naming
scheme
where
the
first
name
represented
the
genus
and
the
second
identified
the
species
within
the
genus
.
For
the
purposes
of
identification
,
Linnaeus
's
Systema
Sexuale
classified
plants
into
24
groups
according
to
the
number
of
their
male
sexual
organs
.
The
24th
group
,
Cryptogamia
,
included
all
plants
with
concealed
reproductive
parts
,
mosses
,
liverworts
,
ferns
,
algae
and
fungi
.
Increasing
knowledge
of
plant
anatomy
,
morphology
and
life
cycles
led
to
the
realisation
that
there
were
more
natural
affinities
between
plants
than
the
artificial
sexual
system
of
Linnaeus
had
indicated
.
Adanson
(
1763
)
,
de
Jussieu
(
1789
)
,
and
Candolle
(
1819
)
all
proposed
various
alternative
natural
systems
of
classification
that
grouped
plants
using
a
wider
range
of
shared
characters
and
were
widely
followed
.
The
Candollean
system
reflected
his
ideas
of
the
progression
of
morphological
complexity
and
the
later
classification
by
Bentham
and
Hooker
,
which
was
influential
until
the
mid-19th
century
,
was
influenced
by
Candolle
's
approach
.
Darwin
's
publication
of
the
Origin
of
Species
in
1859
and
his
concept
of
common
descent
required
modifications
to
the
Candollean
system
to
reflect
evolutionary
relationships
as
distinct
from
mere
morphological
similarity
.
Botany
was
greatly
stimulated
by
the
appearance
of
the
first
"
modern
"
text
book
,
Matthias
Schleiden
's
Grundzüge
der
Wissenschaftlichen
Botanik
,
published
in
English
in
1849
as
Principles
of
Scientific
Botany
.
Schleiden
was
a
microscopist
and
an
early
plant
anatomist
who
co-founded
the
cell
theory
with
Theodor
Schwann
and
Rudolf
Virchow
and
was
among
the
first
to
grasp
the
significance
of
the
cell
nucleus
that
had
been
described
by
Robert
Brown
in
1831
.
In
1855
,
Adolf
Fick
formulated
Fick
's
laws
that
enabled
the
calculation
of
the
rates
of
molecular
diffusion
in
biological
systems
.
The
discipline
of
plant
ecology
was
pioneered
in
the
late
19th
century
by
botanists
such
as
Eugenius
Warming
,
who
produced
the
hypothesis
that
plants
form
communities
,
and
his
mentor
and
successor
Christen
C.
Raunkiær
whose
system
for
describing
plant
life
forms
is
still
in
use
today
.
The
concept
that
the
composition
of
plant
communities
such
as
temperate
broadleaf
forest
changes
by
a
process
of
ecological
succession
was
developed
by
Henry
Chandler
Cowles
,
Arthur
Tansley
and
Frederic
Clements
.
Clements
is
credited
with
the
idea
of
climax
vegetation
as
the
most
complex
vegetation
that
an
environment
can
support
and
Tansley
introduced
the
concept
of
ecosystems
to
biology
.
Building
on
the
extensive
earlier
work
of
Alphonse
de
Candolle
,
Nikolai
Vavilov
(
1887
–
1943
)
produced
accounts
of
the
biogeography
,
centres
of
origin
,
and
evolutionary
history
of
economic
plants
.
Particularly
since
the
mid-1960s
there
have
been
advances
in
understanding
of
the
physics
of
plant
physiological
processes
such
as
transpiration
(
the
transport
of
water
within
plant
tissues
)
,
the
temperature
dependence
of
rates
of
water
evaporation
from
the
leaf
surface
and
the
molecular
diffusion
of
water
vapour
and
carbon
dioxide
through
stomatal
apertures
.
These
developments
,
coupled
with
new
methods
for
measuring
the
size
of
stomatal
apertures
,
and
the
rate
of
photosynthesis
have
enabled
precise
description
of
the
rates
of
gas
exchange
between
plants
and
the
atmosphere
.
Innovations
in
statistical
analysis
by
Ronald
Fisher
,
Frank
Yates
and
others
at
Rothamsted
Experimental
Station
facilitated
rational
experimental
design
and
data
analysis
in
botanical
research
.
The
discovery
and
identification
of
the
auxin
plant
hormones
by
Kenneth
V.
Thimann
in
1948
enabled
regulation
of
plant
growth
by
externally
applied
chemicals
.
Frederick
Campion
Steward
pioneered
techniques
of
micropropagation
and
plant
tissue
culture
controlled
by
plant
hormones
.
The
synthetic
auxin
2,4
-
Dichlorophenoxyacetic
acid
or
2,4
-
D
was
one
of
the
first
commercial
synthetic
herbicides
.
20th
century
developments
in
plant
biochemistry
have
been
driven
by
modern
techniques
of
organic
chemical
analysis
,
such
as
spectroscopy
,
chromatography
and
electrophoresis
.
With
the
rise
of
the
related
molecular-scale
biological
approaches
of
molecular
biology
,
genomics
,
proteomics
and
metabolomics
,
the
relationship
between
the
plant
genome
and
most
aspects
of
the
biochemistry
,
physiology
,
morphology
and
behaviour
of
plants
can
be
subjected
to
detailed
experimental
analysis
.
The
concept
originally
stated
by
Gottlieb
Haberlandt
in
1902
that
all
plant
cells
are
totipotent
and
can
be
grown
in
vitro
ultimately
enabled
the
use
of
genetic
engineering
experimentally
to
knock
out
a
gene
or
genes
responsible
for
a
specific
trait
,
or
to
add
genes
such
as
GFP
that
report
when
a
gene
of
interest
is
being
expressed
.
These
technologies
enable
the
biotechnological
use
of
whole
plants
or
plant
cell
cultures
grown
in
bioreactors
to
synthesise
pesticides
,
antibiotics
or
other
pharmaceuticals
,
as
well
as
the
practical
application
of
genetically
modified
crops
designed
for
traits
such
as
improved
yield
.
Modern
morphology
recognizes
a
continuum
between
the
major
morphological
categories
of
root
,
stem
(
caulome
)
,
leaf
(
phyllome
)
and
trichome
.
Furthermore
,
it
emphasizes
structural
dynamics
.
Modern
systematics
aims
to
reflect
and
discover
phylogenetic
relationships
between
plants
.
Modern
Molecular
phylogenetics
largely
ignores
morphological
characters
,
relying
on
DNA
sequences
as
data
.
Molecular
analysis
of
DNA
sequences
from
most
families
of
flowering
plants
enabled
the
Angiosperm
Phylogeny
Group
to
publish
in
1998
a
phylogeny
of
flowering
plants
,
answering
many
of
the
questions
about
relationships
among
angiosperm
families
and
species
.
The
theoretical
possibility
of
a
practical
method
for
identification
of
plant
species
and
commercial
varieties
by
DNA
barcoding
is
the
subject
of
active
current
research
.
The
study
of
plants
is
vital
because
they
underpin
almost
all
animal
life
on
Earth
by
generating
a
large
proportion
of
the
oxygen
and
food
that
provide
humans
and
other
organisms
with
aerobic
respiration
with
the
chemical
energy
they
need
to
exist
.
Plants
,
algae
and
cyanobacteria
are
the
major
groups
of
organisms
that
carry
out
photosynthesis
,
a
process
that
uses
the
energy
of
sunlight
to
convert
water
and
carbon
dioxide
into
sugars
that
can
be
used
both
as
a
source
of
chemical
energy
and
of
organic
molecules
that
are
used
in
the
structural
components
of
cells
.
As
a
by-product
of
photosynthesis
,
plants
release
oxygen
into
the
atmosphere
,
a
gas
that
is
required
by
nearly
all
living
things
to
carry
out
cellular
respiration
.
In
addition
,
they
are
influential
in
the
global
carbon
and
water
cycles
and
plant
roots
bind
and
stabilise
soils
,
preventing
soil
erosion
.
Plants
are
crucial
to
the
future
of
human
society
as
they
provide
food
,
oxygen
,
medicine
,
and
products
for
people
,
as
well
as
creating
and
preserving
soil
.
The
strictest
definition
of
"
plant
"
includes
only
the
"
land
plants
"
or
embryophytes
,
which
include
seed
plants
(
gymnosperms
,
including
the
pines
,
and
flowering
plants
)
and
the
free-sporing
cryptogams
including
ferns
,
clubmosses
,
liverworts
,
hornworts
and
mosses
.
Embryophytes
are
multicellular
eukaryotes
descended
from
an
ancestor
that
obtained
its
energy
from
sunlight
by
photosynthesis
.
They
have
life
cycles
with
alternating
haploid
and
diploid
phases
.
The
sexual
haploid
phase
of
embryophytes
,
known
as
the
gametophyte
,
nurtures
the
developing
diploid
embryo
sporophyte
within
its
tissues
for
at
least
part
of
its
life
,
even
in
the
seed
plants
,
where
the
gametophyte
itself
is
nurtured
by
its
parent
sporophyte
.
Other
groups
of
organisms
that
were
previously
studied
by
botanists
include
bacteria
(
now
studied
in
bacteriology
)
,
fungi
(
mycology
)
–
including
lichen
-
forming
fungi
(
lichenology
)
,
non-chlorophyte
algae
(
phycology
)
,
and
viruses
(
virology
)
.
However
,
attention
is
still
given
to
these
groups
by
botanists
,
and
fungi
(
including
lichens
)
and
photosynthetic
protists
are
usually
covered
in
introductory
botany
courses
.
Paleobotanists
study
ancient
plants
in
the
fossil
record
to
provide
information
about
the
evolutionary
history
of
plants
.
Cyanobacteria
,
the
first
oxygen-
releasing
photosynthetic
organisms
on
Earth
,
are
thought
to
have
given
rise
to
the
ancestor
of
plants
by
entering
into
an
endosymbiotic
relationship
with
an
early
eukaryote
,
ultimately
becoming
the
chloroplasts
in
plant
cells
.
The
new
photosynthetic
plants
(
along
with
their
algal
relatives
)
accelerated
the
rise
in
atmospheric
oxygen
started
by
the
cyanobacteria
,
changing
the
ancient
oxygen
-free
,
reducing
,
atmosphere
to
one
in
which
free
oxygen
has
been
abundant
for
more
than
2
billion
years
.
Virtually
all
staple
foods
come
either
directly
from
primary
production
by
plants
,
or
indirectly
from
animals
that
eat
them
.
Plants
and
other
photosynthetic
organisms
are
at
the
base
of
most
food
chains
because
they
use
the
energy
from
the
sun
and
nutrients
from
the
soil
and
atmosphere
,
converting
them
into
a
form
that
can
be
used
by
animals
.
This
is
what
ecologists
call
the
first
trophic
level
.
The
modern
forms
of
the
major
staple
foods
,
such
as
maize
,
rice
,
wheat
and
other
cereal
grasses
,
pulses
,
bananas
and
plantains
,
as
well
as
flax
and
cotton
grown
for
their
fibres
,
are
the
outcome
of
prehistoric
selection
over
thousands
of
years
from
among
wild
ancestral
plants
with
the
most
desirable
characteristics
.
Botanists
study
how
plants
produce
food
and
how
to
increase
yields
,
for
example
through
plant
breeding
,
making
their
work
important
to
mankind
's
ability
to
feed
the
world
and
provide
food
security
for
future
generations
.
Botanists
also
study
weeds
,
which
are
a
considerable
problem
in
agriculture
,
and
the
biology
and
control
of
plant
pathogens
in
agriculture
and
natural
ecosystems
.
Ethnobotany
is
the
study
of
the
relationships
between
plants
and
people
.
When
applied
to
the
investigation
of
historical
plant–people
relationships
ethnobotany
may
be
referred
to
as
archaeobotany
or
palaeoethnobotany
.
Plants
and
various
other
groups
of
photosynthetic
eukaryotes
collectively
known
as
"
algae
"
have
unique
organelles
known
as
chloroplasts
.
Chloroplasts
are
thought
to
be
descended
from
cyanobacteria
that
formed
endosymbiotic
relationships
with
ancient
plant
and
algal
ancestors
.
Chloroplasts
and
cyanobacteria
contain
the
blue-green
pigment
chlorophyll
a
.
Chlorophyll
a
(
as
well
as
its
plant
and
green
algal-
specific
cousin
chlorophyll
b
)
[
a
]
absorbs
light
in
the
blue-violet
and
orange
/
red
parts
of
the
spectrum
while
reflecting
and
transmitting
the
green
light
that
we
see
as
the
characteristic
colour
of
these
organisms
.
The
energy
in
the
red
and
blue
light
that
these
pigments
absorb
is
used
by
chloroplasts
to
make
energy
-
rich
carbon
compounds
from
carbon
dioxide
and
water
by
oxygenic
photosynthesis
,
a
process
that
generates
molecular
oxygen
(
O2
)
as
a
by-product
.
The
light
energy
captured
by
chlorophyll
a
is
initially
in
the
form
of
electrons
(
and
later
a
proton
gradient
)
that
's
used
to
make
molecules
of
ATP
and
NADPH
which
temporarily
store
and
transport
energy
.
Their
energy
is
used
in
the
light
-
independent
reactions
of
the
Calvin
cycle
by
the
enzyme
rubisco
to
produce
molecules
of
the
3
-
carbon
sugar
glyceraldehyde
3
-
phosphate
(
G3P
)
.
Glyceraldehyde
3
-
phosphate
is
the
first
product
of
photosynthesis
and
the
raw
material
from
which
glucose
and
almost
all
other
organic
molecules
of
biological
origin
are
synthesized
.
Some
of
the
glucose
is
converted
to
starch
which
is
stored
in
the
chloroplast
.
Starch
is
the
characteristic
energy
store
of
most
land
plants
and
algae
,
while
inulin
,
a
polymer
of
fructose
is
used
for
the
same
purpose
in
the
sunflower
family
Asteraceae
.
Some
of
the
glucose
is
converted
to
sucrose
(
common
table
sugar
)
for
export
to
the
rest
of
the
plant
.
Plants
synthesize
a
number
of
unique
polymers
like
the
polysaccharide
molecules
cellulose
,
pectin
and
xyloglucan
from
which
the
land
plant
cell
wall
is
constructed
.
Vascular
land
plants
make
lignin
,
a
polymer
used
to
strengthen
the
secondary
cell
walls
of
xylem
tracheids
and
vessels
to
keep
them
from
collapsing
when
a
plant
sucks
water
through
them
under
water
stress
.
Lignin
is
also
used
in
other
cell
types
like
sclerenchy
ma
fibers
that
provide
structural
support
for
a
plant
and
is
a
major
constituent
of
wood
.
Sporopollenin
is
a
chemically
resistant
polymer
found
in
the
outer
cell
walls
of
spores
and
pollen
of
land
plants
responsible
for
the
survival
of
early
land
plant
spores
and
the
pollen
of
seed
plants
in
the
fossil
record
.
It
is
widely
regarded
as
a
marker
for
the
start
of
land
plant
evolution
during
the
Ordovician
period
.
The
concentration
of
carbon
dioxide
in
the
atmosphere
today
is
much
lower
than
it
was
when
plants
emerged
onto
land
during
the
Ordovician
and
Silurian
periods
.
Many
monocots
like
maize
and
the
pineapple
and
some
dicots
like
the
Asteraceae
have
since
independently
evolved
pathways
like
Crassulacean
acid
metabolism
and
the
C4
carbon
fixation
pathway
for
photosynthesis
which
avoid
the
losses
resulting
from
photorespiration
in
the
more
common
C3
carbon
fixation
pathway
.
These
biochemical
strategies
are
unique
to
land
plants
.
Phytochemistry
is
a
branch
of
plant
biochemistry
primarily
concerned
with
the
chemical
substances
produced
by
plants
during
secondary
metabolism
.
Some
of
these
compounds
are
toxins
such
as
the
alkaloid
coniine
from
hemlock
.
Others
,
such
as
the
essential
oils
peppermint
oil
and
lemon
oil
are
useful
for
their
aroma
,
as
flavourings
and
spices
(
e.g.
,
capsaicin
)
,
and
in
medicine
as
pharmaceuticals
as
in
opium
from
opium
poppies
.
Many
medicinal
and
recreational
drugs
,
such
as
tetrahydrocannabinol
(
active
ingredient
in
cannabis
)
,
caffeine
,
morphine
and
nicotine
come
directly
from
plants
.
Others
are
simple
derivatives
of
botanical
natural
products
.
For
example
,
the
pain
killer
aspirin
is
the
acetyl
ester
of
salicylic
acid
,
originally
isolated
from
the
bark
of
willow
trees
,
and
a
wide
range
of
opiate
painkillers
like
heroin
are
obtained
by
chemical
modification
of
morphine
obtained
from
the
opium
poppy
.
Popular
stimulants
come
from
plants
,
such
as
caffeine
from
coffee
,
tea
and
chocolate
,
and
nicotine
from
tobacco
.
Most
alcoholic
beverages
come
from
fermentation
of
carbohydrate
-
rich
plant
products
such
as
barley
(
beer
)
,
rice
(
sake
)
and
grapes
(
wine
)
.
Sugar
,
starch
,
cotton
,
linen
,
hemp
,
some
types
of
rope
,
wood
and
particle
boards
,
papyrus
and
paper
,
vegetable
oils
,
wax
,
and
natural
rubber
are
examples
of
commercially
important
materials
made
from
plant
tissues
or
their
secondary
products
.
Charcoal
,
a
pure
form
of
carbon
made
by
pyrolysis
of
wood
,
has
a
long
history
as
a
metal-smelting
fuel
,
as
a
filter
material
and
adsorbent
and
as
an
artist
's
material
and
is
one
of
the
three
ingredients
of
gunpowder
.
Cellulose
,
the
world
's
most
abundant
organic
polymer
,
can
be
converted
into
energy
,
fuels
,
materials
and
chemical
feedstock
.
Products
made
from
cellulose
include
rayon
and
cellophane
,
wallpaper
paste
,
biobutanol
and
gun
cotton
.
Sugarcane
,
rapeseed
and
soy
are
some
of
the
plants
with
a
highly
fermentable
sugar
or
oil
content
that
are
used
as
sources
of
biofuels
,
important
alternatives
to
fossil
fuels
,
such
as
biodiesel
.
Plant
ecology
is
the
science
of
the
functional
relationships
between
plants
and
their
habitats
—
the
environments
where
they
complete
their
life
cycles
.
Plant
ecologists
study
the
composition
of
local
and
regional
floras
,
their
biodiversity
,
genetic
diversity
and
fitness
,
the
adaptation
of
plants
to
their
environment
,
and
their
competitive
or
mutualistic
interactions
with
other
species
.
The
goals
of
plant
ecology
are
to
understand
the
causes
of
their
distribution
patterns
,
productivity
,
environmental
impact
,
evolution
,
and
responses
to
environmental
change
.
Plants
depend
on
certain
edaphic
(
soil
)
and
climatic
factors
in
their
environment
but
can
modify
these
factors
too
.
For
example
,
they
can
change
their
environment
's
albedo
,
increase
runoff
interception
,
stabilize
mineral
soils
and
develop
their
organic
content
,
and
affect
local
temperature
.
Plants
compete
with
other
organisms
in
their
ecosystem
for
resources
.
They
interact
with
their
neighbours
at
a
variety
of
spatial
scales
in
groups
,
populations
and
communities
that
collectively
constitute
vegetation
.
Regions
with
characteristic
vegetation
types
and
dominant
plants
as
well
as
similar
abiotic
and
biotic
factors
,
climate
,
and
geography
make
up
biomes
like
tundra
or
tropical
rainforest
.
Plant
responses
to
climate
and
other
environmental
changes
can
inform
our
understanding
of
how
these
changes
affect
ecosystem
function
and
productivity
.
For
example
,
plant
phenology
can
be
a
useful
proxy
for
temperature
in
historical
climatology
,
and
the
biological
impact
of
climate
change
and
global
warming
.
Palynology
,
the
analysis
of
fossil
pollen
deposits
in
sediments
from
thousands
or
millions
of
years
ago
allows
the
reconstruction
of
past
climates
.
Estimates
of
atmospheric
CO2
concentrations
since
the
Palaeozoic
have
been
obtained
from
stomatal
densities
and
the
leaf
shapes
and
sizes
of
ancient
land
plants
.
Ozone
depletion
can
expose
plants
to
higher
levels
of
ultraviolet
radiation
-
B
(
UV
-
B
)
,
resulting
in
lower
growth
rates
.
Moreover
,
information
from
studies
of
community
ecology
,
plant
systematics
,
and
taxonomy
is
essential
to
understanding
vegetation
change
,
habitat
destruction
and
species
extinction
.
Inheritance
in
plants
follows
the
same
fundamental
principles
of
genetics
as
in
other
multicellular
organisms
.
Gregor
Mendel
discovered
the
genetic
laws
of
inheritance
by
studying
inherited
traits
such
as
shape
in
Pisum
sativum
(
peas
)
.
What
Mendel
learned
from
studying
plants
has
had
far
reaching
benefits
outside
of
botany
.
Similarly
,
"
jumping
genes
"
were
discovered
by
Barbara
McClintock
while
she
was
studying
maize
.
Nevertheless
,
there
are
some
distinctive
genetic
differences
between
plants
and
other
organisms
.
Species
boundaries
in
plants
may
be
weaker
than
in
animals
,
and
cross
species
hybrids
are
often
possible
.
A
familiar
example
is
peppermint
,
Mentha
×
piperita
,
a
sterile
hybrid
between
Mentha
aquatica
and
spearmint
,
Mentha
spicata
.
The
many
cultivated
varieties
of
wheat
are
the
result
of
multiple
inter
-
and
intra-specific
crosses
between
wild
species
and
their
hybrids
.
Angiosperms
with
monoecious
flowers
often
have
self-
incompatibility
mechanisms
that
operate
between
the
pollen
and
stigma
so
that
the
pollen
either
fails
to
reach
the
stigma
or
fails
to
germinate
and
produce
male
gametes
.
This
is
one
of
several
methods
used
by
plants
to
promote
outcrossing
.
In
many
land
plants
the
male
and
female
gametes
are
produced
by
separate
individuals
.
These
species
are
said
to
be
dioecious
when
referring
to
vascular
plant
sporophytes
and
dioicous
when
referring
to
bryophyte
gametophytes
.
Unlike
in
higher
animals
,
where
parthenogenesis
is
rare
,
asexual
reproduction
may
occur
in
plants
by
several
different
mechanisms
.
The
formation
of
stem
tubers
in
potato
is
one
example
.
Particularly
in
arctic
or
alpine
habitats
,
where
opportunities
for
fertilisation
of
flowers
by
animals
are
rare
,
plantlets
or
bulbs
,
may
develop
instead
of
flowers
,
replacing
sexual
reproduction
with
asexual
reproduction
and
giving
rise
to
clonal
populations
genetically
identical
to
the
parent
.
This
is
one
of
several
types
of
apomixis
that
occur
in
plants
.
Apomixis
can
also
happen
in
a
seed
,
producing
a
seed
that
contains
an
embryo
genetically
identical
to
the
parent
.
Most
sexually
reproducing
organisms
are
diploid
,
with
paired
chromosomes
,
but
doubling
of
their
chromosome
number
may
occur
due
to
errors
in
cytokinesis
.
This
can
occur
early
in
development
to
produce
an
autopolyploid
or
partly
autopolyploid
organism
,
or
during
normal
processes
of
cellular
differentiation
to
produce
some
cell
types
that
are
polyploid
(
endopolyploidy
)
,
or
during
gamete
formation
.
An
allopolyploid
plant
may
result
from
a
hybridisation
event
between
two
different
species
.
Both
autopolyploid
and
allopolyploid
plants
can
often
reproduce
normally
,
but
may
be
unable
to
cross-breed
successfully
with
the
parent
population
because
there
is
a
mismatch
in
chromosome
numbers
.
These
plants
that
are
reproductively
isolated
from
the
parent
species
but
live
within
the
same
geographical
area
,
may
be
sufficiently
successful
to
form
a
new
species
.
Some
otherwise
sterile
plant
polyploids
can
still
reproduce
vegetatively
or
by
seed
apomixis
,
forming
clonal
populations
of
identical
individuals
.
Durum
wheat
is
a
fertile
tetraploid
allopolyploid
,
while
bread
wheat
is
a
fertile
hexaploid
.
The
commercial
banana
is
an
example
of
a
sterile
,
seedless
triploid
hybrid
.
Common
dandelion
is
a
triploid
that
produces
viable
seeds
by
apomictic
seed
.
A
considerable
amount
of
new
knowledge
about
plant
function
comes
from
studies
of
the
molecular
genetics
of
model
plants
such
as
the
Thale
cress
,
Arabidopsis
thaliana
,
a
weedy
species
in
the
mustard
family
(
Brassicaceae
)
.
The
genome
or
hereditary
information
contained
in
the
genes
of
this
species
is
encoded
by
about
135
million
base
pairs
of
DNA
,
forming
one
of
the
smallest
genomes
among
flowering
plants
.
Arabidopsis
was
the
first
plant
to
have
its
genome
sequenced
,
in
2000
.
The
sequencing
of
some
other
relatively
small
genomes
,
of
rice
(
Oryza
sativa
)
and
Brachypodium
distachyon
,
has
made
them
important
model
species
for
understanding
the
genetics
,
cellular
and
molecular
biology
of
cereals
,
grasses
and
monocots
generally
.
Model
plants
such
as
Arabidopsis
thaliana
are
used
for
studying
the
molecular
biology
of
plant
cells
and
the
chloroplast
.
Ideally
,
these
organisms
have
small
genomes
that
are
well
known
or
completely
sequenced
,
small
stature
and
short
generation
times
.
Corn
has
been
used
to
study
mechanisms
of
photosynthesis
and
phloem
loading
of
sugar
in
C4
plants
.
The
single
celled
green
alga
Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii
,
while
not
an
embryophyte
itself
,
contains
a
green-pigmented
chloroplast
related
to
that
of
land
plants
,
making
it
useful
for
study
.
A
red
alga
Cyanidioschyzon
merolae
has
also
been
used
to
study
some
basic
chloroplast
functions
.
Spinach
,
peas
,
soybeans
and
a
moss
Physcomitrella
patens
are
commonly
used
to
study
plant
cell
biology
.
Agrobacterium
tumefaciens
,
a
soil
rhizosphere
bacterium
,
can
attach
to
plant
cells
and
infect
them
with
a
callus-inducing
Ti
plasmid
by
horizontal
gene
transfer
,
causing
a
callus
infection
called
crown
gall
disease
.
Schell
and
Van
Montagu
(
1977
)
hypothesised
that
the
Ti
plasmid
could
be
a
natural
vector
for
introducing
the
Nif
gene
responsible
for
nitrogen
fixation
in
the
root
nodules
of
legumes
and
other
plant
species
.
Today
,
genetic
modification
of
the
Ti
plasmid
is
one
of
the
main
techniques
for
introduction
of
transgenes
to
plants
and
the
creation
of
genetically
modified
crops
.
Epigenetics
is
the
study
of
mitotically
and
/
or
meiotically
heritable
changes
in
gene
function
that
cannot
be
explained
by
changes
in
the
underlying
DNA
sequence
but
cause
the
organism
's
genes
to
behave
(
or
"
express
themselves
"
)
differently
.
One
example
of
epigenetic
change
is
the
marking
of
the
genes
by
DNA
methylation
which
determines
whether
they
will
be
expressed
or
not
.
Gene
expression
can
also
be
controlled
by
repressor
proteins
that
attach
to
silencer
regions
of
the
DNA
and
prevent
that
region
of
the
DNA
code
from
being
expressed
.
Epigenetic
marks
may
be
added
or
removed
from
the
DNA
during
programmed
stages
of
development
of
the
plant
,
and
are
responsible
,
for
example
,
for
the
differences
between
anthers
,
petals
and
normal
leaves
,
despite
the
fact
that
they
all
have
the
same
underlying
genetic
code
.
Epigenetic
changes
may
be
temporary
or
may
remain
through
successive
cell
divisions
for
the
remainder
of
the
cell
's
life
.
Some
epigenetic
changes
have
been
shown
to
be
heritable
,
while
others
are
reset
in
the
germ
cells
.
Epigenetic
changes
in
eukaryotic
biology
serve
to
regulate
the
process
of
cellular
differentiation
.
During
morphogenesis
,
totipotent
stem
cells
become
the
various
pluripotent
cell
lines
of
the
embryo
,
which
in
turn
become
fully
differentiated
cells
.
A
single
fertilized
egg
cell
,
the
zygote
,
gives
rise
to
the
many
different
plant
cell
types
including
parenchyma
,
xylem
vessel
elements
,
phloem
sieve
tubes
,
guard
cells
of
the
epidermis
,
etc.
as
it
continues
to
divide
.
The
process
results
from
the
epigenetic
activation
of
some
genes
and
inhibition
of
others
.
Unlike
animals
,
many
plant
cells
,
particularly
those
of
the
parenchyma
,
do
not
terminally
differentiate
,
remaining
totipotent
with
the
ability
to
give
rise
to
a
new
individual
plant
.
Exceptions
include
highly
lignified
cells
,
the
sclerenchyma
and
xylem
which
are
dead
at
maturity
,
and
the
phloem
sieve
tubes
which
lack
nuclei
.
While
plants
use
many
of
the
same
epigenetic
mechanisms
as
animals
,
such
as
chromatin
remodeling
,
an
alternative
hypothesis
is
that
plants
set
their
gene
expression
patterns
using
positional
information
from
the
environment
and
surrounding
cells
to
determine
their
developmental
fate
.
The
algae
are
a
polyphyletic
group
and
are
placed
in
various
divisions
,
some
more
closely
related
to
plants
than
others
.
There
are
many
differences
between
them
in
features
such
as
cell
wall
composition
,
biochemistry
,
pigmentation
,
chloroplast
structure
and
nutrient
reserves
.
The
algal
division
Charophyta
,
sister
to
the
green
algal
division
Chlorophyta
,
is
considered
to
contain
the
ancestor
of
true
plants
.
The
Charophyte
class
Charophyceae
and
the
land
plant
sub-kingdom
Embryophyta
together
form
the
monophyletic
group
or
clade
Streptophytina
.
Nonvascular
land
plants
are
embryophytes
that
lack
the
vascular
tissues
xylem
and
phloem
.
They
include
mosses
,
liverworts
and
hornworts
.
Pteridophytic
vascular
plants
with
true
xylem
and
phloem
that
reproduced
by
spores
germinating
into
free-living
gametophytes
evolved
during
the
Silurian
period
and
diversified
into
several
lineages
during
the
late
Silurian
and
early
Devonian
.
Representatives
of
the
lycopods
have
survived
to
the
present
day
.
By
the
end
of
the
Devonian
period
,
several
groups
,
including
the
lycopods
,
sphenophylls
and
progymnosperms
,
had
independently
evolved
"
megaspory
"
–
their
spores
were
of
two
distinct
sizes
,
larger
megaspores
and
smaller
microspores
.
Their
reduced
gametophytes
developed
from
megaspores
retained
within
the
spore-producing
organs
(
megasporangia
)
of
the
sporophyte
,
a
condition
known
as
endospory
.
Seeds
consist
of
an
endosporic
megasporangium
surrounded
by
one
or
two
sheathing
layers
(
integuments
)
.
The
young
sporophyte
develops
within
the
seed
,
which
on
germination
splits
to
release
it
.
The
earliest
known
seed
plants
date
from
the
latest
Devonian
Famennian
stage
.
Following
the
evolution
of
the
seed
habit
,
seed
plants
diversified
,
giving
rise
to
a
number
of
now-extinct
groups
,
including
seed
ferns
,
as
well
as
the
modern
gymnosperms
and
angiosperms
.
Gymnosperms
produce
"
naked
seeds
"
not
fully
enclosed
in
an
ovary
;
modern
representatives
include
conifers
,
cycads
,
Ginkgo
,
and
Gnetales
.
Angiosperms
produce
seeds
enclosed
in
a
structure
such
as
a
carpel
or
an
ovary
.
Ongoing
research
on
the
molecular
phylogenetics
of
living
plants
appears
to
show
that
the
angiosperms
are
a
sister
clade
to
the
gymnosperms
.
Plant
physiology
encompasses
all
the
internal
chemical
and
physical
activities
of
plants
associated
with
life
.
Chemicals
obtained
from
the
air
,
soil
and
water
form
the
basis
of
all
plant
metabolism
.
The
energy
of
sunlight
,
captured
by
oxygenic
photosynthesis
and
released
by
cellular
respiration
,
is
the
basis
of
almost
all
life
.
Photoautotrophs
,
including
all
green
plants
,
algae
and
cyanobacteria
gather
energy
directly
from
sunlight
by
photosynthesis
.
Heterotrophs
including
all
animals
,
all
fungi
,
all
completely
parasitic
plants
,
and
non-photosynthetic
bacteria
take
in
organic
molecules
produced
by
photoautotrophs
and
respire
them
or
use
them
in
the
construction
of
cells
and
tissues
.
Respiration
is
the
oxidation
of
carbon
compounds
by
breaking
them
down
into
simpler
structures
to
release
the
energy
they
contain
,
essentially
the
opposite
of
photosynthesis
.
Molecules
are
moved
within
plants
by
transport
processes
that
operate
at
a
variety
of
spatial
scales
.
Subcellular
transport
of
ions
,
electrons
and
molecules
such
as
water
and
enzymes
occurs
across
cell
membranes
.
Minerals
and
water
are
transported
from
roots
to
other
parts
of
the
plant
in
the
transpiration
stream
.
Diffusion
,
osmosis
,
and
active
transport
and
mass
flow
are
all
different
ways
transport
can
occur
.
Examples
of
elements
that
plants
need
to
transport
are
nitrogen
,
phosphorus
,
potassium
,
calcium
,
magnesium
,
and
sulphur
.
In
vascular
plants
,
these
elements
are
extracted
from
the
soil
as
soluble
ions
by
the
roots
and
transported
throughout
the
plant
in
the
xylem
.
Most
of
the
elements
required
for
plant
nutrition
come
from
the
chemical
breakdown
of
soil
minerals
.
Sucrose
produced
by
photosynthesis
is
transported
from
the
leaves
to
other
parts
of
the
plant
in
the
phloem
and
plant
hormones
are
transported
by
a
variety
of
processes
.
The
hypothesis
that
plant
growth
and
development
is
coordinated
by
plant
hormones
or
plant
growth
regulators
first
emerged
in
the
late
19th
century
.
Darwin
experimented
on
the
movements
of
plant
shoots
and
roots
towards
light
and
gravity
,
and
concluded
"
It
is
hardly
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
the
tip
of
the
radicle
.
.
acts
like
the
brain
of
one
of
the
lower
animals
.
.
directing
the
several
movements
"
.
About
the
same
time
,
the
role
of
auxins
(
from
the
Greek
auxein
,
to
grow
)
in
control
of
plant
growth
was
first
outlined
by
the
Dutch
scientist
Frits
Went
.
The
first
known
auxin
,
indole-3
-
acetic
acid
(
IAA
)
,
which
promotes
cell
growth
,
was
only
isolated
from
plants
about
50
years
later
.
This
compound
mediates
the
tropic
responses
of
shoots
and
roots
towards
light
and
gravity
.
The
finding
in
1939
that
plant
callus
could
be
maintained
in
culture
containing
IAA
,
followed
by
the
observation
in
1947
that
it
could
be
induced
to
form
roots
and
shoots
by
controlling
the
concentration
of
growth
hormones
were
key
steps
in
the
development
of
plant
biotechnology
and
genetic
modification
.
Cytokinins
are
a
class
of
plant
hormones
named
for
their
control
of
cell
division
or
cytokinesis
.
The
natural
cytokinin
zeatin
was
discovered
in
corn
,
Zea
mays
,
and
is
a
derivative
of
the
purine
adenine
.
Zeatin
is
produced
in
roots
and
transported
to
shoots
in
the
xylem
where
it
promotes
cell
division
,
bud
development
,
and
the
greening
of
chloroplasts
.
The
gibberelins
,
such
as
Gibberelic
acid
are
diterpenes
synthesised
from
acetyl
CoA
via
the
mevalonate
pathway
.
They
are
involved
in
the
promotion
of
germination
and
dormancy
-
breaking
in
seeds
,
in
regulation
of
plant
height
by
controlling
stem
elongation
and
the
control
of
flowering
.
Abscisic
acid
(
ABA
)
occurs
in
all
land
plants
except
liverworts
,
and
is
synthesised
from
carotenoids
in
the
chloroplasts
and
other
plastids
.
It
inhibits
cell
division
,
promotes
seed
maturation
,
and
dormancy
,
and
promotes
stomatal
closure
.
It
was
so
named
because
it
was
originally
thought
to
control
abscission
.
Ethylene
is
a
gaseous
hormone
that
is
produced
in
all
higher
plant
tissues
from
methionine
.
It
is
now
known
to
be
the
hormone
that
stimulates
or
regulates
fruit
ripening
and
abscission
,
and
it
,
or
the
synthetic
growth
regulator
ethephon
which
is
rapidly
metabolised
to
produce
ethylene
,
are
used
on
industrial
scale
to
promote
ripening
of
cotton
,
pineapples
and
other
climacteric
crops
.
Plant
anatomy
is
the
study
of
the
structure
of
plant
cells
and
tissues
,
whereas
plant
morphology
is
the
study
of
their
external
form
.
All
plants
are
multicellular
eukaryotes
,
their
DNA
stored
in
nuclei
.
The
characteristic
features
of
plant
cells
that
distinguish
them
from
those
of
animals
and
fungi
include
a
primary
cell
wall
composed
of
the
polysaccharides
cellulose
,
hemicellulose
and
pectin
,
larger
vacuoles
than
in
animal
cells
and
the
presence
of
plastids
with
unique
photosynthetic
and
biosynthetic
functions
as
in
the
chloroplasts
.
Other
plastids
contain
storage
products
such
as
starch
(
amyloplasts
)
or
lipids
(
elaioplasts
)
.
Uniquely
,
streptophyte
cells
and
those
of
the
green
algal
order
Trentepohliales
divide
by
construction
of
a
phragmoplast
as
a
template
for
building
a
cell
plate
late
in
cell
division
.
The
bodies
of
vascular
plants
including
clubmosses
,
ferns
and
seed
plants
(
gymnosperms
and
angiosperms
)
generally
have
aerial
and
subterranean
subsystems
.
The
shoots
consist
of
stems
bearing
green
photosynthesising
leaves
and
reproductive
structures
.
The
underground
vascularised
roots
bear
root
hairs
at
their
tips
and
generally
lack
chlorophyll
.
Non-vascular
plants
,
the
liverworts
,
hornworts
and
mosses
do
not
produce
ground
-
penetrating
vascular
roots
and
most
of
the
plant
participates
in
photosynthesis
.
The
sporophyte
generation
is
nonphotosynthetic
in
liverworts
but
may
be
able
to
contribute
part
of
its
energy
needs
by
photosynthesis
in
mosses
and
hornworts
.
The
root
system
and
the
shoot
system
are
interdependent
–
the
usually
nonphotosynthetic
root
system
depends
on
the
shoot
system
for
food
,
and
the
usually
photosynthetic
shoot
system
depends
on
water
and
minerals
from
the
root
system
.
Cells
in
each
system
are
capable
of
creating
cells
of
the
other
and
producing
adventitious
shoots
or
roots
.
Stolons
and
tubers
are
examples
of
shoots
that
can
grow
roots
.
Roots
that
spread
out
close
to
the
surface
,
such
as
those
of
willows
,
can
produce
shoots
and
ultimately
new
plants
.
In
the
event
that
one
of
the
systems
is
lost
,
the
other
can
often
regrow
it
.
In
fact
it
is
possible
to
grow
an
entire
plant
from
a
single
leaf
,
as
is
the
case
with
Saintpaulia
,
or
even
a
single
cell
–
which
can
dedifferentiate
into
a
callus
(
a
mass
of
unspecialised
cells
)
that
can
grow
into
a
new
plant
.
In
vascular
plants
,
the
xylem
and
phloem
are
the
conductive
tissues
that
transport
resources
between
shoots
and
roots
.
Roots
are
often
adapted
to
store
food
such
as
sugars
or
starch
,
as
in
sugar
beets
and
carrots
.
Stems
mainly
provide
support
to
the
leaves
and
reproductive
structures
,
but
can
store
water
in
succulent
plants
such
as
cacti
,
food
as
in
potato
tubers
,
or
reproduce
vegetatively
as
in
the
stolons
of
strawberry
plants
or
in
the
process
of
layering
.
Leaves
gather
sunlight
and
carry
out
photosynthesis
.
Large
,
flat
,
flexible
,
green
leaves
are
called
foliage
leaves
.
Gymnosperms
,
such
as
conifers
,
cycads
,
Ginkgo
,
and
gnetophytes
are
seed
-
producing
plants
with
open
seeds
.
Angiosperms
are
seed-
producing
plants
that
produce
flowers
and
have
enclosed
seeds
.
Woody
plants
,
such
as
azaleas
and
oaks
,
undergo
a
secondary
growth
phase
resulting
in
two
additional
types
of
tissues
:
wood
(
secondary
xylem
)
and
bark
(
secondary
phloem
and
cork
)
.
All
gymnosperms
and
many
angiosperms
are
woody
plants
.
Some
plants
reproduce
sexually
,
some
asexually
,
and
some

Systematic
botany
is
part
of
systematic
biology
,
which
is
concerned
with
the
range
and
diversity
of
organisms
and
their
relationships
,
particularly
as
determined
by
their
evolutionary
history
.
It
involves
,
or
is
related
to
,
biological
classification
,
scientific
taxonomy
and
phylogenetics
.
Biological
classification
is
the
method
by
which
botanists
group
organisms
into
categories
such
as
genera
or
species
.
Biological
classification
is
a
form
of
scientific
taxonomy
.
Modern
taxonomy
is
rooted
in
the
work
of
Carl
Linnaeus
,
who
grouped
species
according
to
shared
physical
characteristics
.
These
groupings
have
since
been
revised
to
align
better
with
the
Darwinian
principle
of
common
descent
–
grouping
organisms
by
ancestry
rather
than
superficial
characteristics
.
While
scientists
do
not
always
agree
on
how
to
classify
organisms
,
molecular
phylogenetics
,
which
uses
DNA
sequences
as
data
,
has
driven
many
recent
revisions
along
evolutionary
lines
and
is
likely
to
continue
to
do
so
.
The
dominant
classification
system
is
called
Linnaean
taxonomy
.
It
includes
ranks
and
binomial
nomenclature
.
The
nomenclature
of
botanical
organisms
is
codified
in
the
International
Code
of
Nomenclature
for
algae
,
fungi
,
and
plants
(
ICN
)
and
administered
by
the
International
Botanical
Congress
.
Kingdom
Plantae
belongs
to
Domain
Eukarya
and
is
broken
down
recursively
until
each
species
is
separately
classified
.
The
order
is
:
Kingdom
;
Phylum
(
or
Division
)
;
Class
;
Order
;
Family
;
Genus
(
plural
genera
)
;
Species
.
The
scientific
name
of
a
plant
represents
its
genus
and
its
species
within
the
genus
,
resulting
in
a
single
world
-
wide
name
for
each
organism
.
For
example
,
the
tiger
lily
is
Lilium
columbianum
.
Lilium
is
the
genus
,
and
columbianum
the
specific
epithet
.
The
combination
is
the
name
of
the
species
.
When
writing
the
scientific
name
of
an
organism
,
it
is
proper
to
capitalise
the
first
letter
in
the
genus
and
put
all
of
the
specific
epithet
in
lowercase
.
Additionally
,
the
entire
term
is
ordinarily
italicised
(
or
underlined
when
italics
are
not
available
)
.
The
evolutionary
relationships
and
heredity
of
a
group
of
organisms
is
called
its
phylogeny
.
Phylogenetic
studies
attempt
to
discover
phylogenies
.
The
basic
approach
is
to
use
similarities
based
on
shared
inheritance
to
determine
relationships
.
As
an
example
,
species
of
Pereskia
are
trees
or
bushes
with
prominent
leaves
.
They
do
not
obviously
resemble
a
typical
leafless
cactus
such
as
an
Echinocactus
.
However
,
both
Pereskia
and
Echinocactus
have
spines
produced
from
areoles
(
highly
specialised
pad-like
structures
)
suggesting
that
the
two
genera
are
indeed
related
.
Judging
relationships
based
on
shared
characters
requires
care
,
since
plants
may
resemble
one
another
through
convergent
evolution
in
which
characters
have
arisen
independently
.
Some
euphorbias
have
leafless
,
rounded
bodies
adapted
to
water
conservation
similar
to
those
of
globular
cacti
,
but
characters
such
as
the
structure
of
their
flowers
make
it
clear
that
the
two
groups
are
not
closely
related
.
The
cladistic
method
takes
a
systematic
approach
to
characters
,
distinguishing
between
those
that
carry
no
information
about
shared
evolutionary
history
–
such
as
those
evolved
separately
in
different
groups
(
homoplasies
)
or
those
left
over
from
ancestors
(
plesiomorphies
)
–
and
derived
characters
,
which
have
been
passed
down
from
innovations
in
a
shared
ancestor
(
apomorphies
)
.
Only
derived
characters
,
such
as
the
spine-
producing
areoles
of
cacti
,
provide
evidence
for
descent
from
a
common
ancestor
.
The
results
of
cladistic
analyses
are
expressed
as
cladograms
:
tree-like
diagrams
showing
the
pattern
of
evolutionary
branching
and
descent
.
From
the
1990s
onwards
,
the
predominant
approach
to
constructing
phylogenies
for
living
plants
has
been
molecular
phylogenetics
,
which
uses
molecular
characters
,
particularly
DNA
sequences
,
rather
than
morphological
characters
like
the
presence
or
absence
of
spines
and
areoles
.
The
difference
is
that
the
genetic
code
itself
is
used
to
decide
evolutionary
relationships
,
instead
of
being
used
indirectly
via
the
characters
it
gives
rise
to
.
Clive
Stace
describes
this
as
having
"
direct
access
to
the
genetic
basis
of
evolution
.
"
As
a
simple
example
,
prior
to
the
use
of
genetic
evidence
,
fungi
were
thought
either
to
be
plants
or
to
be
more
closely
related
to
plants
than
animals
.
Genetic
evidence
suggests
that
the
true
evolutionary
relationship
of
multicelled
organisms
is
as
shown
in
the
cladogram
below
–
fungi
are
more
closely
related
to
animals
than
to
plants
.
In
1998
the
Angiosperm
Phylogeny
Group
published
a
phylogeny
for
flowering
plants
based
on
an
analysis
of
DNA
sequences
from
most
families
of
flowering
plants
.
As
a
result
of
this
work
,
many
questions
,
such
as
which
families
represent
the
earliest
branches
of
angiosperms
,
have
now
been
answered
.
Investigating
how
plant
species
are
related
to
each
other
allows
botanists
to
better
understand
the
process
of
evolution
in
plants
.
Despite
the
study
of
model
plants
and
increasing
use
of
DNA
evidence
,
there
is
ongoing
work
and
discussion
among
taxonomists
about
how
best
to
classify
plants
into
various
taxa
.
Technological
developments
such
as
computers
and
electron
microscopes
have
greatly
increased
the
level
of
detail
studied
and
speed
at
which
data
can
be
analysed
.

officially
the
Republic
of
the
Union
of
Myanmar
and
also
known
as
Burma
,
is
a
sovereign
state
in
Southeast
Asia
bordered
by
Bangladesh
,
India
,
China
,
Laos
and
Thailand
.
One
-third
of
Myanmar
's
total
perimeter
of
1,930
km
(
1,200
miles
)
forms
an
uninterrupted
coastline
along
the
Bay
of
Bengal
and
the
Andaman
Sea
.
The
country
's
2014
census
revealed
a
much
lower
population
than
expected
,
with
51
million
people
recorded
.
Myanmar
is
676,578
square
kilometres
(
261,227
sq
mi
)
in
size
.
Its
capital
city
is
Naypyidaw
and
its
largest
city
is
Yangon
(
Rangoon
)
.
Early
civilisations
in
Myanmar
included
the
Tibeto-Burman-speaking
Pyu
city
-states
in
Upper
Burma
and
the
Mon
kingdoms
in
Lower
Burma
.
In
the
9th
century
,
the
Bamar
people
entered
the
upper
Irrawaddy
valley
and
,
following
the
establishment
of
the
Pagan
Kingdom
in
the
1050s
,
the
Burmese
language
,
culture
and
Theravada
Buddhism
slowly
became
dominant
in
the
country
.
The
Pagan
Kingdom
fell
due
to
the
Mongol
invasions
and
several
warring
states
emerged
.
In
the
16th
century
,
reunified
by
the
Taungoo
Dynasty
,
the
country
was
for
a
brief
period
the
largest
empire
in
the
history
of
Southeast
Asia
.
The
early
19th
century
Konbaung
Dynasty
ruled
over
an
area
that
included
modern
Myanmar
and
briefly
controlled
Manipur
and
Assam
as
well
.
The
British
conquered
Myanmar
after
three
Anglo-Burmese
Wars
in
the
19th
century
and
the
country
became
a
British
colony
.
Myanmar
became
an
independent
nation
in
1948
,
initially
as
a
democratic
nation
and
then
,
following
a
coup
d'état
in
1962
,
a
military
dictatorship
.
For
most
of
its
independent
years
,
the
country
has
been
engrossed
in
rampant
ethnic
strife
and
Burma
's
myriad
ethnic
groups
have
been
involved
in
one
of
the
world
's
longest
-
running
ongoing
civil
wars
.
During
this
time
,
the
United
Nations
and
several
other
organisations
have
reported
consistent
and
systematic
human
rights
violations
in
the
country
.
In
2011
,
the
military
junta
was
officially
dissolved
following
a
2010
general
election
,
and
a
nominally
civilian
government
was
installed
.
While
former
military
leaders
still
wield
enormous
power
in
the
country
,
Burmese
Military
have
taken
steps
toward
relinquishing
control
of
the
government
.
This
,
along
with
the
release
of
Aung
San
Suu
Kyi
and
political
prisoners
,
has
improved
the
country
's
human
rights
record
and
foreign
relations
,
and
has
led
to
the
easing
of
trade
and
other
economic
sanctions
.
There
is
,
however
,
continuing
criticism
of
the
government
's
treatment
of
the
Muslim
Rohingya
minority
and
its
poor
response
to
the
religious
clashes
.
In
the
landmark
2015
election
,
Aung
San
Suu
Kyi
's
party
won
a
majority
in
both
houses
,
ending
military
rule
.
In
English
,
the
country
is
popularly
known
as
either
"
Burma
"
or
"
Myanmar
"
i
/
ˈmjɑːnˌmɑːr
/
.
Both
these
names
are
derived
from
the
name
of
the
majority
Burmese
Bamar
ethnic
group
.
Myanmar
is
considered
to
be
the
literary
form
of
the
name
of
the
group
,
while
Burma
is
derived
from
"
Bamar
"
,
the
colloquial
form
of
the
group
's
name
.
Depending
on
the
register
used
,
the
pronunciation
would
be
Bama
(
pronounced
:
[
bəmà
]
)
or
Myamah
(
pronounced
:
[
mjəmà
]
)
.
The
name
Burma
has
been
in
use
in
English
since
the
18th
century
.
Burma
continues
to
be
used
in
English
by
the
governments
of
many
countries
,
such
as
Australia
,
Canada
and
the
United
Kingdom
.
Official
United
States
policy
retains
Burma
as
the
country
's
name
,
although
the
State
Department
's
website
lists
the
country
as
"
Burma
(
Myanmar
)
"
and
Barack
Obama
has
referred
to
the
country
by
both
names
.
The
Czech
Republic
uses
officially
Myanmar
,
although
its
Ministry
of
Foreign
Affairs
mentions
both
Myanmar
and
Burma
on
its
website
.
The
United
Nations
uses
Myanmar
,
as
do
the
Association
of
Southeast
Asian
Nations
,
Russia
,
Germany
,
China
,
India
,
Norway
,
and
Japan
.
Archaeological
evidence
shows
that
Homo
erectus
lived
in
the
region
now
known
as
Myanmar
as
early
as
400,000
years
ago
.
The
first
evidence
of
Homo
sapiens
is
dated
to
about
11,000
BC
,
in
a
Stone
Age
culture
called
the
Anyathian
with
discoveries
of
stone
tools
in
central
Myanmar
.
Evidence
of
neolithic
age
domestication
of
plants
and
animals
and
the
use
of
polished
stone
tools
dating
to
sometime
between
10,000
and
6,000
BC
has
been
discovered
in
the
form
of
cave
paintings
near
the
city
of
Taunggyi
.
The
Bronze
Age
arrived
circa
1500
BC
when
people
in
the
region
were
turning
copper
into
bronze
,
growing
rice
and
domesticating
poultry
and
pigs
;
they
were
among
the
first
people
in
the
world
to
do
so
.
Human
remains
and
artifacts
from
this
era
were
discovered
in
Monywa
District
in
the
Sagaing
Division
.
The
Iron
Age
began
around
500
BC
with
the
emergence
of
iron-working
settlements
in
an
area
south
of
present-
day
Mandalay
.
Evidence
also
shows
the
presence
of
rice-growing
settlements
of
large
villages
and
small
towns
that
traded
with
their
surroundings
as
far
as
China
between
500
BC
and
200
AD
.
Iron
Age
Burmese
cultures
also
had
influences
from
outside
sources
such
as
India
and
Thailand
,
as
seen
in
their
funerary
practices
concerning
child
burials
.
This
indicates
some
form
of
communication
between
groups
in
Myanmar
and
other
places
,
possibly
through
trade
.
Around
the
second
century
BC
the
first-known
city
-states
emerged
in
central
Myanmar
.
The
city
-states
were
founded
as
part
of
the
southward
migration
by
the
Tibeto-Burman
-
speaking
Pyu
city
-states
,
the
earliest
inhabitants
of
Myanmar
of
whom
records
are
extant
,
from
present
-
day
Yunnan
.
The
Pyu
culture
was
heavily
influenced
by
trade
with
India
,
importing
Buddhism
as
well
as
other
cultural
,
architectural
and
political
concepts
which
would
have
an
enduring
influence
on
later
Burmese
culture
and
political
organisation
.
Pagan
's
collapse
was
followed
by
250
years
of
political
fragmentation
that
lasted
well
into
the
16th
century
.
Like
the
Burmans
four
centuries
earlier
,
Shan
migrants
who
arrived
with
the
Mongol
invasions
stayed
behind
.
Several
competing
Shan
States
came
to
dominate
the
entire
northwestern
to
eastern
arc
surrounding
the
Irrawaddy
valley
.
The
valley
too
was
beset
with
petty
states
until
the
late
14th
century
when
two
sizeable
powers
,
Ava
Kingdom
and
Hanthawaddy
Kingdom
,
emerged
.
In
the
west
,
a
politically
fragmented
Arakan
was
under
competing
influences
of
its
stronger
neighbours
until
the
Kingdom
of
Mrauk
U
unified
the
Arakan
coastline
for
the
first
time
in
1437
.
Like
the
Pagan
Empire
,
Ava
,
Hanthawaddy
and
the
Shan
states
were
all
multi-ethnic
polities
.
Despite
the
wars
,
cultural
synchronisation
continued
.
This
period
is
considered
a
golden
age
for
Burmese
culture
.
Burmese
literature
"
grew
more
confident
,
popular
,
and
stylistically
diverse
"
,
and
the
second
generation
of
Burmese
law
codes
as
well
as
the
earliest
pan-Burma
chronicles
emerged
.
Hanthawaddy
monarchs
introduced
religious
reforms
that
later
spread
to
the
rest
of
the
country
.
Many
splendid
temples
of
Mrauk
U
were
built
during
this
period
.
Political
unification
returned
in
the
mid-16th
century
,
due
to
the
efforts
of
Taungoo
,
a
former
vassal
state
of
Ava
.
Taungoo
's
young
,
ambitious
king
Tabinshwehti
defeated
the
more
powerful
Hanthawaddy
in
the
Toungoo–Hanthawaddy
War
(
1534–
41
)
.
His
successor
Bayinnaung
went
on
to
conquer
a
vast
swath
of
mainland
Southeast
Asia
including
the
Shan
states
,
Lan
Na
,
Manipur
,
Mong
Mao
,
the
Ayutthaya
Kingdom
,
Lan
Xang
and
southern
Arakan
.
However
,
the
largest
empire
in
the
history
of
Southeast
Asia
unravelled
soon
after
Bayinnaung
's
death
in
1581
,
completely
collapsing
by
1599
.
Ayutthaya
seized
Tenasserim
and
Lan
Na
,
and
Portuguese
mercenaries
established
Portuguese
rule
at
Thanlyin
(
Syriam
)
.
The
dynasty
regrouped
and
defeated
the
Portuguese
in
1613
and
Siam
in
1614
.
It
restored
a
smaller
,
more
manageable
kingdom
,
encompassing
Lower
Myanmar
,
Upper
Myanmar
,
Shan
states
,
Lan
Na
and
upper
Tenasserim
.
The
Restored
Toungoo
kings
created
a
legal
and
political
framework
whose
basic
features
would
continue
well
into
the
19th
century
.
The
crown
completely
replaced
the
hereditary
chieftainships
with
appointed
governorships
in
the
entire
Irrawaddy
valley
,
and
greatly
reduced
the
hereditary
rights
of
Shan
chiefs
.
Its
trade
and
secular
administrative
reforms
built
a
prosperous
economy
for
more
than
80
years
.
From
the
1720s
onward
,
the
kingdom
was
beset
with
repeated
Meithei
raids
into
Upper
Myanmar
and
a
nagging
rebellion
in
Lan
Na
.
In
1740
,
the
Mon
of
Lower
Myanmar
founded
the
Restored
Hanthawaddy
Kingdom
.
Hanthawaddy
forces
sacked
Ava
in
1752
,
ending
the
266
-
year
-
old
Toungoo
Dynasty
.
With
Burma
preoccupied
by
the
Chinese
threat
,
Ayutthaya
recovered
its
territories
by
1770
,
and
went
on
to
capture
Lan
Na
by
1776
.
Burma
and
Siam
went
to
war
until
1855
,
but
all
resulted
in
a
stalemate
,
exchanging
Tenasserim
(
to
Burma
)
and
Lan
Na
(
to
Ayutthaya
)
.
Faced
with
a
powerful
China
and
a
resurgent
Ayutthaya
in
the
east
,
King
Bodawpaya
turned
west
,
acquiring
Arakan
(
1785
)
,
Manipur
(
1814
)
and
Assam
(
1817
)
.
It
was
the
second-largest
empire
in
Burmese
history
but
also
one
with
a
long
ill-defined
border
with
British
India
.
Konbaung
kings
extended
Restored
Toungoo
's
administrative
reforms
,
and
achieved
unprecedented
levels
of
internal
control
and
external
expansion
.
For
the
first
time
in
history
,
the
Burmese
language
and
culture
came
to
predominate
the
entire
Irrawaddy
valley
.
The
evolution
and
growth
of
Burmese
literature
and
theatre
continued
,
aided
by
an
extremely
high
adult
male
literacy
rate
for
the
era
(
half
of
all
males
and
5
%
of
females
)
.
Nonetheless
,
the
extent
and
pace
of
reforms
were
uneven
and
ultimately
proved
insufficient
to
stem
the
advance
of
British
colonialism
.
Burmese
resentment
was
strong
and
was
vented
in
violent
riots
that
paralysed
Yangon
(
Rangoon
)
on
occasion
all
the
way
until
the
1930s
.
Some
of
the
discontent
was
caused
by
a
disrespect
for
Burmese
culture
and
traditions
such
as
the
British
refusal
to
remove
shoes
when
they
entered
pagodas
.
Buddhist
monks
became
the
vanguards
of
the
independence
movement
.
U
Wisara
,
an
activist
monk
,
died
in
prison
after
a
166
-
day
hunger
strike
to
protest
against
a
rule
that
forbade
him
from
wearing
his
Buddhist
robes
while
imprisoned
.
A
major
battleground
,
Burma
was
devastated
during
World
War
II
.
By
March
1942
,
within
months
after
they
entered
the
war
,
Japanese
troops
had
advanced
on
Rangoon
and
the
British
administration
had
collapsed
.
A
Burmese
Executive
Administration
headed
by
Ba
Maw
was
established
by
the
Japanese
in
August
1942
.
Wingate
's
British
Chindits
were
formed
into
long-range
penetration
groups
trained
to
operate
deep
behind
Japanese
lines
.
A
similar
American
unit
,
Merrill
's
Marauders
,
followed
the
Chindits
into
the
Burmese
jungle
in
1943
.
Beginning
in
late
1944
,
allied
troops
launched
a
series
of
offensives
that
led
to
the
end
of
Japanese
rule
in
July
1945
.
The
battles
were
intense
with
much
of
Burma
laid
waste
by
the
fighting
.
Overall
,
the
Japanese
lost
some
150,000
men
in
Burma
.
Only
1,700
prisoners
were
taken
.
Following
World
War
II
,
Aung
San
negotiated
the
Panglong
Agreement
with
ethnic
leaders
that
guaranteed
the
independence
of
Myanmar
as
a
unified
state
.
Aung
Zan
Wai
,
Pe
Khin
,
Bo
Hmu
Aung
,
Sir
Maung
Gyi
,
Dr.
Sein
Mya
Maung
,
Myoma
U
Than
Kywe
were
among
the
negotiators
of
the
historical
Panglong
Conference
negotiated
with
Bamar
leader
General
Aung
San
and
other
ethnic
leaders
in
1947
.
In
1947
,
Aung
San
became
Deputy
Chairman
of
the
Executive
Council
of
Myanmar
,
a
transitional
government
.
But
in
July
1947
,
political
rivals
assassinated
Aung
San
and
several
cabinet
members
.
In
1988
,
unrest
over
economic
mismanagement
and
political
oppression
by
the
government
led
to
widespread
pro-democracy
demonstrations
throughout
the
country
known
as
the
8888
Uprising
.
Security
forces
killed
thousands
of
demonstrators
,
and
General
Saw
Maung
staged
a
coup
d'état
and
formed
the
State
Law
and
Order
Restoration
Council
(
SLORC
)
.
In
1989
,
SLORC
declared
martial
law
after
widespread
protests
.
The
military
government
finalised
plans
for
People
's
Assembly
elections
on
31
May
1989
.
SLORC
changed
the
country
's
official
English
name
from
the
"
Socialist
Republic
of
the
Union
of
Burma
"
to
the
"
Union
of
Myanmar
"
in
1989
.
In
August
2007
,
an
increase
in
the
price
of
diesel
and
petrol
led
to
Saffron
Revolution
led
by
Buddhist
monks
that
were
dealt
with
harshly
by
the
government
.
The
government
cracked
down
on
them
on
26
September
2007
.
The
crackdown
was
harsh
,
with
reports
of
barricades
at
the
Shwedagon
Pagoda
and
monks
killed
.
There
were
also
rumours
of
disagreement
within
the
Burmese
armed
forces
,
but
none
was
confirmed
.
The
military
crackdown
against
unarmed
protesters
was
widely
condemned
as
part
of
the
International
reactions
to
the
Saffron
Revolution
and
led
to
an
increase
in
economic
sanctions
against
the
Burmese
Government
.
In
May
2008
,
Cyclone
Nargis
caused
extensive
damage
in
the
densely
populated
,
rice
-farming
delta
of
the
Irrawaddy
Division
.
It
was
the
worst
natural
disaster
in
Burmese
history
with
reports
of
an
estimated
200,000
people
dead
or
missing
,
and
damage
totalled
to
10
billion
US
Dollars
,
and
as
many
as
1
million
left
homeless
.
In
the
critical
days
following
this
disaster
,
Myanmar
's
isolationist
government
was
accused
of
hindering
United
Nations
recovery
efforts
.
Humanitarian
aid
was
requested
but
concerns
about
foreign
military
or
intelligence
presence
in
the
country
delayed
the
entry
of
United
States
military
planes
delivering
medicine
,
food
,
and
other
supplies
.
In
October
2012
the
number
of
ongoing
conflicts
in
Myanmar
included
the
Kachin
conflict
,
between
the
Pro-Christian
Kachin
Independence
Army
and
the
government
;
a
civil
war
between
the
Rohingya
Muslims
,
and
the
government
and
non-government
groups
in
Rakhine
State
;
and
a
conflict
between
the
Shan
,
Lahu
and
Karen
minority
groups
,
and
the
government
in
the
eastern
half
of
the
country
.
In
addition
al
-
Qaeda
signalled
an
intention
to
become
involved
in
Myanmar
.
In
a
video
released
3
September
2014
mainly
addressed
to
India
,
the
militant
group
's
leader
Ayman
al
-
Zawahiri
said
al
-
Qaeda
had
not
forgotten
the
Muslims
of
Myanmar
and
that
the
group
was
doing
"
what
they
can
to
rescue
you
"
.
In
response
,
the
military
raised
its
level
of
alertness
while
the
Burmese
Muslim
Association
issued
a
statement
saying
Muslims
would
not
tolerate
any
threat
to
their
motherland
.
Armed
conflict
between
ethnic
Chinese
rebels
and
the
Myanmar
Armed
Forces
have
resulted
in
the
Kokang
offensive
in
February
2015
.
The
conflict
had
forced
40,000
to
50,000
civilians
to
flee
their
homes
and
seek
shelter
on
the
Chinese
side
of
the
border
.
During
the
incident
the
government
of
China
was
accused
of
giving
military
assistance
to
the
ethnic
Chinese
rebels
.
Burmese
officials
have
been
historically
'
manipulated
'
and
pressured
by
the
communist
Chinese
government
throughout
Burmese
modern
history
to
create
closer
and
binding
ties
with
China
,
creating
a
Chinese
satellite
state
in
Southeast
Asia
.
The
goal
of
the
Burmese
constitutional
referendum
of
2008
,
held
on
10
May
2008
,
is
the
creation
of
a
"
discipline
-
flourishing
democracy
"
.
As
part
of
the
referendum
process
,
the
name
of
the
country
was
changed
from
the
"
Union
of
Myanmar
"
to
the
"
Republic
of
the
Union
of
Myanmar
"
,
and
general
elections
were
held
under
the
new
constitution
in
2010
.
Observer
accounts
of
the
2010
election
describe
the
event
as
mostly
peaceful
;
however
,
allegations
of
polling
station
irregularities
were
raised
,
and
the
United
Nations
(
UN
)
and
a
number
of
Western
countries
condemned
the
elections
as
fraudulent
.
Opinions
differ
whether
the
transition
to
liberal
democracy
is
underway
.
According
to
some
reports
,
the
military
's
presence
continues
as
the
label
'
disciplined
democracy
'
suggests
.
This
label
asserts
that
the
Burmese
military
is
allowing
certain
civil
liberties
while
clandestinely
institutionalising
itself
further
into
Burmese
politics
.
Such
an
assertion
assumes
that
reforms
only
occurred
when
the
military
was
able
to
safeguard
its
own
interests
through
the
transition
—
here
,
"
transition
"
does
not
refer
to
a
transition
to
a
liberal
democracy
,
but
transition
to
a
quasi-military
rule
.
Since
the
2010
election
,
the
government
has
embarked
on
a
series
of
reforms
to
direct
the
country
towards
liberal
democracy
,
a
mixed
economy
,
and
reconciliation
,
although
doubts
persist
about
the
motives
that
underpin
such
reforms
.
The
series
of
reforms
includes
the
release
of
pro-democracy
leader
Aung
San
Suu
Kyi
from
house
arrest
,
the
establishment
of
the
National
Human
Rights
Commission
,
the
granting
of
general
amnesties
for
more
than
200
political
prisoners
,
new
labour
laws
that
permit
labour
unions
and
strikes
,
a
relaxation
of
press
censorship
,
and
the
regulation
of
currency
practices
.
The
impact
of
the
post-election
reforms
has
been
observed
in
numerous
areas
,
including
ASEAN
's
approval
of
Myanmar
's
bid
for
the
position
of
ASEAN
chair
in
2014
;
the
visit
by
United
States
Secretary
of
State
Hillary
Clinton
in
December
2011
for
the
encouragement
of
further
progress
—
it
was
the
first
visit
by
a
Secretary
of
State
in
more
than
fifty
years
(
Clinton
met
with
the
Burmese
president
and
former
military
commander
Thein
Sein
,
as
well
as
opposition
leader
Aung
San
Suu
Kyi
)
;
and
the
participation
of
Aung
San
Suu
Kyi's
National
League
for
Democracy
(
NLD
)
party
in
the
2012
by-elections
,
facilitated
by
the
government
's
abolition
of
the
laws
that
previously
barred
the
NLD
.
As
of
July
2013
,
about
100
political
prisoners
remain
imprisoned
,
while
conflict
between
the
Burmese
Army
and
local
insurgent
groups
continues
.
In
1
April
2012
by-elections
the
NLD
won
43
of
the
45
available
seats
;
previously
an
illegal
organisation
,
the
NLD
had
never
won
a
Burmese
election
until
this
time
.
The
2012
by-elections
were
also
the
first
time
that
international
representatives
were
allowed
to
monitor
the
voting
process
in
Myanmar
.
Following
announcement
of
the
by-elections
,
the
Freedom
House
organisation
raised
concerns
about
"
reports
of
fraud
and
harassment
in
the
lead
up
to
elections
,
including
the
March
23
deportation
of
Somsri
Hananuntasuk
,
executive
director
of
the
Asian
Network
for
Free
Elections
(
ANFREL
)
,
a
regional
network
of
civil
society
organisations
promoting
democratization
.
"
However
,
uncertainties
exist
as
some
other
political
prisoners
have
not
been
released
and
clashes
between
Burmese
troops
and
local
insurgent
groups
continue
.
Burma
is
bordered
in

by
the
Chittagong
Division
of
Bangladesh
and
the
Mizoram

.
Much
of
the
country
lies
between
the
Tropic
of
Cancer
and
the

.
It
lies
in
the
monsoon
region
of

Myanmar
is
less
than
1,000

The
elections
of
2010
resulted
in
a
victory
for
the
military
-
backed
Union
Solidarity
and
Development
Party
.
Various
foreign
observers
questioned
the
fairness
of
the
elections
.
One
criticism
of
the
election
was
that
only
government
sanctioned
political
parties
were
allowed
to
contest
in
it
and
the
popular
National
League
for
Democracy
was
declared
illegal
.
However
,
immediately
following
the
elections
,
the
government
ended
the
house
arrest
of
the
democracy
advocate
and
leader
of
the
National
League
for
Democracy
,
Aung
San
Suu
Kyi
,
and
her
ability
to
move
freely
around
the
country
is
considered
an
important
test
of
the
military
's
movement
toward
more
openness
.
After
unexpected
reforms
in
2011
,
NLD
senior
leaders
have
decided
to
register
as
a
political
party
and
to
field
candidates
in
future
by-elections
.
Though
the
country
's
foreign
relations
,
particularly
with
Western
nations
,
have
been
strained
,
relations
have
thawed
since
the
reforms
following
the
2010
elections
.
After
years
of
diplomatic
isolation
and
economic
and
military
sanctions
,
the
United
States
relaxed
curbs
on
foreign
aid
to
Myanmar
in
November
2011
and
announced
the
resumption
of
diplomatic
relations
on
13
January
2012
The
European
Union
has
placed
sanctions
on
Myanmar
,
including
an
arms
embargo
,
cessation
of
trade
preferences
,
and
suspension
of
all
aid
with
the
exception
of
humanitarian
aid
.
Sanctions
imposed
by
the
United
States
and
European
countries
against
the
former
military
government
,
coupled
with
boycotts
and
other
direct
pressure
on
corporations
by
supporters
of
the
democracy
movement
,
have
resulted
in
the
withdrawal
from
the
country
of
most
US
and
many
European
companies
.
On
13
April
2012
British
Prime
Minister
David
Cameron
called
for
the
economic
sanctions
on
Myanmar
to
be
suspended
in
the
wake
of
the
pro-democracy
party
gaining
43
seats
out
of
a
possible
45
in
the
2012
by-elections
with
the
party
leader
,
Aung
San
Suu
Kyi
becoming
a
member
of
the
Burmese
parliament
.
Despite
Western
isolation
,
Asian
corporations
have
generally
remained
willing
to
continue
investing
in
the
country
and
to
initiate
new
investments
,
particularly
in
natural
resource
extraction
.
The
country
has
close
relations
with
neighbouring
India
and
China
with
several
Indian
and
Chinese
companies
operating
in
the
country
.
Under
India
's
Look
East
policy
,
fields
of
co-operation
between
India
and
Myanmar
include
remote
sensing
,
oil
and
gas
exploration
,
information
technology
,
hydro
power
and
construction
of
ports
and
buildings
.
In
2008
,
India
suspended
military
aid
to
Myanmar
over
the
issue
of
human
rights
abuses
by
the
ruling
junta
,
although
it
has
preserved
extensive
commercial
ties
,
which
provide
the
regime
with
much-needed
revenue
.
The
thaw
in
relations
began
on
28
November
2011
,
when
Belarusian
Prime
Minister
Mikhail
Myasnikovich
and
his
wife
Ludmila
arrived
in
the
capital
,
Naypyidaw
,
the
same
day
as
the
country
received
a
visit
by
US
Secretary
of
State
Hillary
Rodham
Clinton
,
who
also
met
with
pro-democracy
opposition
leader
Aung
San
Suu
Kyi
.
International
relations
progress
indicators
continued
in
September
2012
when
Aung
San
Suu
Kyi
visited
to
the
US
followed
by
Myanmar
's
reformist
president
visit
to
the
United
Nations
.
In
May
2013
,
Thein
Sein
became
the
first
Myanmar
president
to
visit
the
White
House
in
47
years
;
the
last
Burmese
leader
to
visit
the
White
House
was
Ne
Win
in
September
1966
.
President
Barack
Obama
praised
the
former
general
for
political
and
economic
reforms
,
and
the
cessation
of
tensions
between
Myanmar
and
the
United
States
.
Political
activists
objected
to
the
visit
due
to
concerns
over
human
rights
abuses
in
Myanmar
but
Obama
assured
Thein
Sein
that
Myanmar
will
receive
US
support
.
The
two
leaders
discussed
to
release
more
political
prisoners
,
the
institutionalisation
of
political
reform
and
rule
of
law
,
and
ending
ethnic
conflict
in
Myanmar
—
the
two
governments
agreed
to
sign
a
bilateral
trade
and
investment
framework
agreement
on
21
May
2013
.
Myanmar
has
received
extensive
military
aid
from
China
in
the
past
Myanmar
has
been
a
member
of
ASEAN
since
1997
.
Though
it
gave
up
its
turn
to
hold
the
ASEAN
chair
and
host
the
ASEAN
Summit
in
2006
,
it
chaired
the
forum
and
hosted
the
summit
in
2014
.
In
November
2008
,
Myanmar
's
political
situation
with
neighbouring
Bangladesh
became
tense
as
they
began
searching
for
natural
gas
in
a
disputed
block
of
the
Bay
of
Bengal
.
Controversy
surrounding
the
Rohingya
population
also
remains
an
issue
between
Bangladesh
and
Myanmar
.
Myanmar
's
armed
forces
are
known
as
the
Tatmadaw
,
which
numbers
488,000
.
The
Tatmadaw
comprises
the
Army
,
the
Navy
,
and
the
Air
Force
.
The
country
ranked
twelfth
in
the
world
for
its
number
of
active
troops
in
service
.
The
military
is
very
influential
in
Myanmar
,
with
all
top
cabinet
and
ministry
posts
usually
held
by
military
officials
.
Official
figures
for
military
spending
are
not
available
.
Estimates
vary
widely
because
of
uncertain
exchange
rates
,
but
Myanmar
's
military
forces
'
expenses
are
high
.
Myanmar
imports
most
of
its
weapons
from
Russia
,
Ukraine
,
China
and
India
.
Until
2005
,
the
United
Nations
General
Assembly
annually
adopted
a
detailed
resolution
about
the
situation
in
Myanmar
by
consensus
.
But
in
2006
a
divided
United
Nations
General
Assembly
voted
through
a
resolution
that
strongly
called
upon
the
government
of
Myanmar
to
end
its
systematic
violations
of
human
rights
.
In
January
2007
,
Russia
and
China
vetoed
a
draft
resolution
before
the
United
Nations
Security
Council
calling
on
the
government
of
Myanmar
to
respect
human
rights
and
begin
a
democratic
transition
.
South
Africa
also
voted
against
the
resolution
.
There
is
consensus
that
the
military
regime
in
Myanmar
is
one
of
the
world
's
most
repressive
and
abusive
regimes
.
In
November
2012
,
Samantha
Power
,
Barack
Obama
's
Special
Assistant
to
the
President
on
Human
Rights
,
wrote
on
the
White
House
blog
in
advance
of
the
president
's
visit
that
"
Serious
human
rights
abuses
against
civilians
in
several
regions
continue
,
including
against
women
and
children
.
"
Members
of
the
United
Nations
and
major
international
human
rights
organisations
have
issued
repeated
and
consistent
reports
of
widespread
and
systematic
human
rights
violations
in
Myanmar
.
The
United
Nations
General
Assembly
has
repeatedly
called
on
the
Burmese
Military
Junta
to
respect
human
rights
and
in
November
2009
the
General
Assembly
adopted
a
resolution
"
strongly
condemning
the
ongoing
systematic
violations
of
human
rights
and
fundamental
freedoms
"
and
calling
on
the
Burmese
Military
Regime
"
to
take
urgent
measures
to
put
an
end
to
violations
of
international
human
rights
and
humanitarian
law
.
"
International
human
rights
organisations
including
Human
Rights
Watch
,
Amnesty
International
and
the
American
Association
for
the
Advancement
of
Science
have
repeatedly
documented
and
condemned
widespread
human
rights
violations
in
Myanmar
.
The
Freedom
in
the
World
2011
report
by
Freedom
House
notes
,
"
The
military
junta
has
...
suppressed
nearly
all
basic
rights
;
and
committed
human
rights
abuses
with
impunity
.
"
In
July
2013
,
the
Assistance
Association
for
Political
Prisoners
indicated
that
there
were
approximately
100
political
prisoners
being
held
in
Burmese
prisons
.
Child
soldiers
have
and
continue
to
play
a
major
part
in
the
Burmese
Army
as
well
as
Burmese
rebel
movements
.
The
Independent
reported
in
June
2012
that
"
Children
are
being
sold
as
conscripts
into
the
Burmese
military
for
as
little
as
$
40
and
a
bag
of
rice
or
a
can
of
petrol
.
"
The
UN's
Special
Representative
of
the
Secretary
-
General
for
Children
and
Armed
Conflict
,
Radhika
Coomaraswamy
,
who
stepped
down
from
her
position
a
week
later
,
met
representatives
of
the
Government
of
Myanmar
on
5
July
2012
and
stated
that
she
hoped
the
government
's
signing
of
an
action
plan
would
"
signal
a
transformation
.
"
In
September
2012
,
the
Myanmar
Armed
Forces
released
42
child
soldiers
and
the
International
Labour
Organization
met
with
representatives
of
the
government
as
well
as
the
Kachin
Independence
Army
to
secure
the
release
of
more
child
soldiers
.
According
to
Samantha
Power
,
a
US
delegation
raised
the
issue
of
child
soldiers
with
the
government
in
October
2012
.
However
,
she
did
not
comment
on
the
government
's
progress
towards
reform
in
this
area
.
The
Rohingya
people
have
consistently
faced
human
rights
abuses
by
the
Burmese
regime
that
has
refused
to
acknowledge
them
as
Burmese
citizens
(
despite
some
of
them
having
lived
in
Burma
for
over
three
generations
)
—
the
Rohingya
have
been
denied
Burmese
citizenship
since
the
enactment
of
a
1982
citizenship
law
.
The
law
created
three
categories
of
citizenship
:
citizenship
,
associate
citizenship
,
and
naturalised
citizenship
.
Citizenship
is
given
to
those
who
belong
to
one
of
the
national
races
such
as
Kachin
,
Kayah
(
Karenni
)
,
Karen
,
Chin
,
Burman
,
Mon
,
Rakhine
,
Shan
,
Kaman
,
or
Zerbadee
.
Associate
citizenship
is
given
to
those
who
cannot
prove
their
ancestors
settled
in
Myanmar
before
1823
,
but
can
prove
they
have
one
grandparent
,
or
pre
-1823
ancestor
,
who
was
a
citizen
of
another
country
,
as
well
as
people
who
applied
for
citizenship
in
1948
and
qualified
then
by
those
laws
.
Naturalized
citizenship
is
only
given
to
those
who
have
at
least
one
parent
with
one
of
these
types
of
Burmese
citizenship
or
can
provide
"
conclusive
evidence
"
that
their
parents
entered
and
resided
in
Burma
prior
to
independence
in
1948
.
The
Burmese
regime
has
attempted
to
forcibly
expel
Rohingya
and
bring
in
non-Rohingyas
to
replace
them
—
this
policy
has
resulted
in
the
expulsion
of
approximately
half
of
the
800,000
Rohingya
from
Burma
,
while
the
Rohingya
people
have
been
described
as
"
among
the
world
's
least
wanted
"
and
"
one
of
the
world
's
most
persecuted
minorities
.
"
But
the
origin
of
‘
most
persecuted
minority
’
statement
is
unclear
.
In
2007
the
German
professor
Bassam
Tibi
suggested
that
the
Rohingya
conflict
may
be
driven
by
an
Islamist
political
agenda
to
impose
religious
laws
,
while
non-religious
causes
have
also
been
raised
,
such
as
a
lingering
resentment
over
the
violence
that
occurred
during
the
Japanese
occupation
of
Burma
in
World
War
II
—
during
this
time
period
the
British
allied
themselves
with
the
Rohingya
and
fought
against
the
puppet
government
of
Burma
(
composed
mostly
of
Bamar
Japanese
)
that
helped
to
establish
the
Tatmadaw
military
organisation
that
remains
in
power
as
of
March
2013
.
Since
the
democratic
transition
began
in
2011
,
there
has
been
continuous
violence
as
280
people
have
been
killed
and
140,000
forced
to
flee
from
their
homes
in
the
Rakhine
state
.
A
UN
envoy
reported
in
March
2013
that
unrest
had
re-emerged
between
Myanmar
's
Buddhist
and
Muslim
communities
,
with
violence
spreading
to
towns
that
are
located
closer
to
Yangon
.
The
BBC
News
media
outlet
obtained
video
footage
of
a
man
with
severe
burns
who
received
no
assistance
from
passers
-
by
or
police
officers
even
though
he
was
lying
on
the
ground
in
a
public
area
.
The
footage
was
filmed
by
members
of
the
Burmese
police
force
in
the
town
of
Meiktila
and
was
used
as
evidence
that
Buddhists
continued
to
kill
Muslims
after
the
European
Union
sanctions
were
lifted
on
23
April
2013
.
The
immediate
cause
of
the
riots
is
unclear
,
with
many
commentators
citing
the
killing
of
ten
Burmese
Muslims
by
ethnic
Rakhine
after
the
rape
and
murder
of
a
Rakhine
woman
as
the
main
cause
.
Whole
villages
have
been
"
decimated
"
.
Over
300
houses
and
a
number
of
public
buildings
have
been
razed
.
According
to
Tun
Khin
,
the
president
of
the
Burmese
Rohingya
Organisation
UK
(
BROUK
)
,
as
of
28
June
2012
,
650
Rohingyas
have
been
killed
,
1,200
are
missing
,
and
more
than
80,000
have
been
displaced
.
According
to
the
Myanmar
authorities
,
the
violence
,
between
ethnic
Rakhine
Buddhists
and
Rohingya
Muslims
,
left
78
people
dead
,
87
injured
,
and
thousands
of
homes
destroyed
.
It
displaced
more
than
52,000
people
.
The
government
has
responded
by
imposing
curfews
and
by
deploying
troops
in
the
regions
.
On
10
June
2012
,
a
state
of
emergency
was
declared
in
Rakhine
,
allowing
the
military
to
participate
in
administration
of
the
region
.
The
Burmese
army
and
police
have
been
accused
of
targeting
Rohingya
Muslims
through
mass
arrests
and
arbitrary
violence
.
A
number
of
monks
'
organisations
that
played
a
vital
role
in
Myanmar
's
struggle
for
democracy
have
taken
measures
to
block
any
humanitarian
assistance
to
the
Rohingya
community
.
Restrictions
on
media
censorship
were
significantly
eased
in
August
2012
following
demonstrations
by
hundreds
of
protesters
who
wore
shirts
demanding
that
the
government
"
Stop
Killing
the
Press
.
"
The
most
significant
change
has
come
in
the
form
that
media
organisations
will
no
longer
have
to
submit
their
content
to
a
censorship
board
before
publication
.
However
,
as
explained
by
one
editorial
in
the
exiled
press
The
Irrawaddy
,
this
new
"
freedom
"
has
caused
some
Burmese
journalists
to
simply
see
the
new
law
as
an
attempt
to
create
an
environment
of
self-censorship
as
journalists
"
are
required
to
follow
16
guidelines
towards
protecting
the
three
national
causes
—
non-disintegration
of
the
Union
,
non-disintegration
of
national
solidarity
,
perpetuation
of
sovereignty
—
and
"
journalistic
ethics
"
to
ensure
their
stories
are
accurate
and
do
not
jeopardise
national
security
.
"
In
July
2014
five
journalists
were
sentenced
to
10
years
in
jail
after
publishing
a
report
saying
the
country
was
planning
to
build
a
new
chemical
weapons
plant
.
Journalists
described
the
jailings
as
a
blow
to
the
recently
-
won
news
media
freedoms
that
had
followed
five
decades
of
censorship
and
persecution
.
According
to
the
Crisis
Group
,
since
Myanmar
transitioned
to
a
new
government
in
August
2011
,
the
country
's
human
rights
record
has
been
improving
.
Previously
giving
Myanmar
its
lowest
rating
of
7
,
the
2012
Freedom
in
the
World
report
also
notes
improvement
,
giving
Myanmar
a
6
for
improvements
in
civil
liberties
and
political
rights
,
the
release
of
political
prisoners
,
and
a
loosening
of
restrictions
.
In
2013
,
Myanmar
improved
yet
again
,
receiving
a
score
of
five
in
civil
liberties
and
a
six
in
political
freedoms
The
government
has
assembled
a
National
Human
Rights
Commission
that
consists
of
15
members
from
various
backgrounds
.
Several
activists
in
exile
,
including
Thee
Lay
Thee
Anyeint
members
,
have
returned
to
Myanmar
after
President
Thein
Sein
's
invitation
to
expatriates
to
return
home
to
work
for
national
development
.
In
an
address
to
the
United
Nations
Security
Council
on
22
September
2011
,
Myanmar
's
Foreign
Minister
Wunna
Maung
Lwin
confirmed
the
government
's
intention
to
release
prisoners
in
the
near
future
.
The
government
has
also
relaxed
reporting
laws
,
but
these
remain
highly
restrictive
.
In
September
2011
,
several
banned
websites
,
including
YouTube
,
Democratic
Voice
of
Burma
and
Voice
of
America
,
were
unblocked
.
A
2011
report
by
the
Hauser
Center
for
Nonprofit
Organizations
found
that
,
while
contact
with
the
Myanmar
government
was
constrained
by
donor
restrictions
,
international
humanitarian
non-governmental
organisations
(
NGOs
)
see
opportunities
for
effective
advocacy
with
government
officials
,
especially
at
the
local
level
.
At
the
same
time
,
international
NGOs
are
mindful
of
the
ethical
quandary
of
how
to
work
with
the
government
without
bolstering
or
appeasing
it
.
Following
Thein
Sein
's
first
ever
visit
to
the
UK
and
a
meeting
with
Prime
Minister
David
Cameron
,
the
Myanmar
president
declared
that
all
of
his
nation
's
political
prisoners
will
be
released
by
the
end
of
2013
,
in
addition
to
a
statement
of
support
for
the
well
-
being
of
the
Rohingya
Muslim
community
.
In
a
speech
at
Chatham
House
,
he
revealed
that
"
We
[
Myanmar
government
]
are
reviewing
all
cases
.
I
guarantee
to
you
that
by
the
end
of
this
year
,
there
will
be
no
prisoners
of
conscience
in
Myanmar
.
"
,
in
addition
to
expressing
a
desire
to
strengthen
links
between
the
UK
and
Myanmar
's
military
forces
.
Under
British
administration
,
Myanmar
was
the
second-
wealthiest
country
in
South
-
East
Asia
.
It
had
been
the
world
's
largest
exporter
of
rice
.
Myanmar
also
had
a
wealth
of
natural
and
labour
resources
.
British
Burma
began
exporting
crude
oil
in
1853
,
making
it
one
of
the
earliest
petroleum
producers
in
the
world
.
It
produced
75
%
of
the
world
's
teak
and
had
a
highly
literate
population
.
The
wealth
was
however
,
mainly
concentrated
in
the
hands
of
Europeans
.
In
1930s
,
agricultural
production
fell
dramatically
as
international
rice
prices
declined
,
and
did
not
recover
for
several
decades
.
During
World
War
II
,
the
British
destroyed
the
major
government
buildings
,
oil
wells
and
mines
for
tungsten
,
tin
,
lead
and
silver
to
keep
them
from
the
Japanese
.
Myanmar
was
bombed
extensively
by
both
sides
.
After
independence
,
the
country
was
in
ruins
with
its
major
infrastructure
completely
destroyed
.
After
a
parliamentary
government
was
formed
in
1948
,
Prime
Minister
U
Nu
embarked
upon
a
policy
of
nationalisation
and
the
state
was
declared
the
owner
of
all
land
.
The
government
also
tried
to
implement
a
poorly
considered
Eight
-
Year
plan
.
By
the
1950s
,
rice
exports
had
fallen
by
two
thirds
and
mineral
exports
by
over
96
%
(
as
compared
to
the
pre-World
War
II
period
)
.
Plans
were
partly
financed
by
printing
money
,
which
led
to
inflation
.
The
major
agricultural
product
is
rice
,
which
covers
about
60
%
of
the
country
's
total
cultivated
land
area
.
Rice
accounts
for
97
%
of
total
food
grain
production
by
weight
.
Through
collaboration
with
the
International
Rice
Research
Institute
52
modern
rice
varieties
were
released
in
the
country
between
1966
and
1997
,
helping
increase
national
rice
production
to
14
million
tons
in
1987
and
to
19
million
tons
in
1996
.
By
1988
,
modern
varieties
were
planted
on
half
of
the
country
's
ricelands
,
including
98
percent
of
the
irrigated
areas
.
In
2008
rice
production
was
estimated
at
50
million
tons
.
Many
US
and
European
jewellery
companies
,
including
Bulgari
,
Tiffany
,
and
Cartier
,
refuse
to
import
these
stones
based
on
reports
of
deplorable
working
conditions
in
the
mines
.
Human
Rights
Watch
has
encouraged
a
complete
ban
on
the
purchase
of
Burmese
gems
based
on
these
reports
and
because
nearly
all
profits
go
to
the
ruling
junta
,
as
the
majority
of
mining
activity
in
the
country
is
government-
run
.
The
government
of
Myanmar
controls
the
gem
trade
by
direct
ownership
or
by
joint
ventures
with
private
owners
of
mines
.
The
most
popular
available
tourist
destinations
in
Myanmar
include
big
cities
such
as
Yangon
and
Mandalay
;
religious
sites
in
Mon
State
,
Pindaya
,
Bago
and
Hpa-An
;
nature
trails
in
Inle
Lake
,
Kengtung
,
Putao
,
Pyin
Oo
Lwin
;
ancient
cities
such
as
Bagan
and
Mrauk

;
as
well
as
beaches
in
Nabule
,
Ngapali
,
Ngwe

,
Mergui
.
Nevertheless
,
much
of
the
country
is
off-limits
to
tourists
,
and
interactions
between
foreigners
and
the
people
of
Myanmar
,
particularly
in
the
border
regions
,
are
subject
to
police
scrutiny
.
They
are
not
to
discuss
politics
with
foreigners
,
under
penalty
of
imprisonment
and
,
in
2001
,
the
Myanmar
Tourism
Promotion
Board
issued
an
order
for
local
officials
to
protect
tourists
and
limit
"
unnecessary
contact
"
between
foreigners
and
ordinary
Burmese
people
.
The
most
common
way
for
travellers
to
enter
the
country
seems
to
be
by
air
.
According
to
the
website
Lonely
Planet
,
getting
into
Myanmar
is
problematic
:
"
No
bus
or
train
service
connects
Myanmar
with
another
country
,
nor
can
you
travel
by
car
or
motorcycle
across
the
border
–
you
must
walk
across
.
"
,
and
states
that
,
"
It
is
not
possible
for
foreigners
to
go
to
/
from
Myanmar
by
sea
or
river
.
"
There
are
a
small
number
of
border
crossings
that
allow
the
passage
of
private
vehicles
,
such
as
the
border
between
Ruili
(
China
)
to
Mu-se
,
the
border
between
Htee
Kee
(
Myanmar
)
and
Ban
Phu
Nam
Ron
(
Thailand
)
(
the
most
direct
border
between
Dawei
and
Kanchanaburi
)
,
and
the
border
between
Myawaddy
(
Myanmar
)
and
Mae
Sot
(
Thailand
)
.
At
least
one
tourist
company
has
successfully
run
commercial
overland
routes
through
these
borders
since
2013
.
"
From
Mae
Sai
(
Thailand
)
you
can
cross
to
Tachileik
,
but
can
only
go
as
far
as
Kengtung
.
Those
in
Thailand
on
a
visa
run
can
cross
to
Kawthaung
but
cannot
venture
farther
into
Myanmar
.
"
Flights
are
available
from
most
countries
,
though
direct
flights
are
limited
to
mainly
Thai
and
other
ASEAN
airlines
.
According
to
Eleven
magazine
,
"
In
the
past
,
there
were
only
15
international
airlines
and
increasing
numbers
of
airlines
have
began
launching
direct

from
Japan
,
Qatar
,
Taiwan
,
South
Korea
,
Germany
and
Singapore
.
"
Expansions
were
expected
in
September
2013
,
but
yet
again
are
mainly
Thai

The
provisional
results
of
the
2014
Myanmar
Census
show
that
the
total
population
is
51,419,420
.
This
figure
includes
an
estimated
1,206,353
persons
in
parts
of
northern
Rakhine
State
,
Kachin

There
are
over
600,000
registered

Myanmar
's
ethnic
minority
groups
prefer
the
term
"
ethnic
nationality
"
over
"
ethnic
minority
"
as
the
term
"
minority
"
furthers
their
sense
of
insecurity
in
the
face
of
what
is
often
described
as
"
Burmanisation
"
—
the
proliferation
and
domination
of
the
dominant
Bamar
culture
over
minority
cultures
.
Mon
,
who
form
2
%
of
the

.
The
remainder
are
Kachin

Included
in
this
group
are
the
Anglo-Burmese
.
Once
forming
a
large
and
influential
community
,
the
Anglo
-
Burmese
left
the
country
in
steady
streams
from
1958
onwards
,
principally
to
Australia
and
the
UK
.
It
is
estimated
that
52,000
Anglo-Burmese
remain
in
Myanmar
.
As

Myanmar
is
home
to
four
major
language
families
:
Sino-Tibetan
,
Tai–Kadai
,
Austro-Asiatic
,
and
Indo-European
.
Sino-Tibetan
languages
are
most
widely
spoken
.
They
include
Burmese
,
Karen
,
Kachin
,
Chin
,
and
Chinese
(
mainly
Hokkien
)
.
The
primary
Tai–Kadai
language
is
Shan
.
Mon
,
Palaung
,
and
Wa
are
the
major
Austroasiatic
languages
spoken
in
Myanmar
.
The
two
major
Indo-European
languages
are
Pali
,
the
liturgical
language
of
Theravada
Buddhism
,
and
English
.
Little
known
fact
about
Myanmar
is
there
are
more
than
130
languages
spoken
by
people
in
Myanmar
.
Since
many
of
them
are
known
only
within
small
tribes
around
the
country
,
they
may
have
been
lost
(
many
if
not
all
)
after
a
few
generations
.
Burmese
,
the
mother
tongue
of
the
Bamar
and
official
language
of
Myanmar
,
is
related
to
Tibetan
and
Chinese
language
.
It
is
written
in
a
script
consisting
of
circular
and
semi-circular
letters
,
which
were
adapted
from
the
Mon
script
,
which
in
turn
was
developed
from
a
southern
Indian
script
in
the
5th
century
.
The
earliest
known
inscriptions
in
the
Burmese
script
date
from
the
11th
century
.
It
is
also
used
to
write
Pali
,
the
sacred
language
of
Theravada
Buddhism
,
as
well
as
several
ethnic
minority
languages
,
including
Shan
,
several
Karen
dialects
,
and
Kayah
(
Karenni
)
,
with
the
addition
of
specialised
characters
and
diacritics
for
each
language
.
Many
religions
are
practised
in
Myanmar
.
Religious
edifices
and
orders
have
been
in
existence
for
many
years
.
Festivals
can
be
held
on
a
grand
scale
.
The
Christian
and
Muslim
populations
do
,
however
,
face
religious
persecution
and
it
is
hard
,
if
not
impossible
,
for
non-Buddhists
to
join
the
army
or
get
government
jobs
,
the
main
route
to
success
in
the
country
.
Such
persecution
and
targeting
of
civilians
is
particularly
notable
in
Eastern
Myanmar
,
where
over
3000
villages
have
been
destroyed
in
the
past
ten
years
.
More
than
200,000
Muslims
have
fled
to
Bangladesh
over
the
last
20
years
to
escape
Islamophobic
persecution
.
According
to
Pew
Research
,
7
%
of
the
population
identifies
as
Christian
;
4
%
as
Muslim
;
1
%
follows
traditional
animistic
beliefs
;
and
2
%
follow
other
religions
,
including
Mahayana
Buddhism
,
Hinduism
,
and
East
Asian
religions
.
However
,
according
to
a
US
State
Department
's
2010
international
religious
freedom
report
,
official
statistics
are
alleged
to
underestimate
the
non-Buddhist
population
.
Independent
researchers
put
the
Muslim
population
at
6
to
10
%
of
the
population

Jehovah
's
Witnesses
have
been
present
since

and
have
about
80
congregations
around
the
country
and
a
branch
office
in
Yangon
publishing
in

The
educational
system
of
Myanmar
is
operated
by
the
government
agency
,
the
Ministry
of
Education
.
The
education
system
is
based
on
the
United
Kingdom
's
system
due
to
nearly
a
century
of
British
and
Christian
presences
in
Myanmar
.
Nearly
all
schools
are
government
-operated
,
but
there
has
been
a
recent
increase
in
privately
funded
English
language
schools
.
Schooling
is
compulsory
until
the
end
of
elementary
school
,
approximately
about
9
years
old
,
while
the
compulsory
schooling
age
is
15
or
16
at
international
level
.
A
diverse
range
of
indigenous
cultures
exist
in
Myanmar
,
the
majority
culture
is
primarily
Buddhist
and
Bamar
.
Bamar
culture
has
been
influenced
by
the
cultures
of
neighbouring
countries
.
This
is
manifested
in
its
language
,
cuisine
,
music
,
dance
and
theatre
.
The
arts
,
particularly
literature
,
have
historically
been
influenced
by
the
local
form
of
Theravada
Buddhism
.
Considered
the
national
epic
of
Myanmar
,
the
Yama
Zatdaw
,
an
adaptation
of
India
's
Ramayana
,
has
been
influenced
greatly
by
Thai
,
Mon
,
and
Indian
versions
of
the
play
.
Buddhism
is
practised
along
with
nat
worship
,
which
involves
elaborate
rituals
to
propitiate
one
from
a
pantheon
of
37
nats
.
In
a
traditional
village
,
the
monastery
is
the
centre
of
cultural
life
.
Monks
are
venerated
and
supported
by
the
lay
people
.
A
novitiation
ceremony
called
shinbyu
is
the
most
important
coming
of
age
events
for
a
boy
,
during
which
he
enters
the
monastery
for
a
short
time
.
All
male
children
in
Buddhist
families
are
encouraged
to
be
a
novice
(
beginner
for
Buddhism
)
before
the
age
of
twenty
and
to
be
a
monk
after
the
age
of
twenty
.
Girls
have
ear-piercing
ceremonies
(
နားသ
)
at
the
same
time
.
Burmese
culture
is
most
evident
in
villages
where
local
festivals
are
held
throughout
the
year
,
the
most
important
being
the
pagoda
festival
.
Many
villages
have
a
guardian
nat
,
and
superstition
and
taboos
are
commonplace
.
British
colonial
rule
introduced
Western
elements
of
culture
to
Burma
.
Burma
's
education
system
is
modelled
after
that
of
the
United
Kingdom
.
Colonial
architectural
influences
are
most
evident
in
major
cities
such
as
Yangon
.
Many
ethnic
minorities
,
particularly
the
Karen
in
the
southeast
and
the
Kachin
and
Chin
who
populate
the
north
and
northeast
,
practice
Christianity
.
According
to
the
The
World
Factbook
,
the
Burman
population
is
68
%
and
the
ethnic
groups
constitute
32
%
.
However
,
the
exiled
leaders
and
organisations
claims
that
ethnic
population
is
40
%
,
which
is
implicitly
contrasted
with
CIA

(
official
US
report
)
.
Mohinga
is
the
traditional
breakfast

as
Sittwe
,
Kyaukpyu
,
Mawlamyaing
(
formerly
Moulmein

in
1920
which
proved
a
major
success
,
despite
its
poor
quality
due
to
a
fixed
camera
position
and
inadequate
film
accessories
.
During
the
1920s
and
1930s
,
many
Burmese-owned
film
companies
made
and
produced
several
films
.
The
first
Burmese
sound
film
was
produced
in
1932
in
Bombay
,
India
with
the
title
Ngwe
Pay
Lo
Ma
Ya
(
Money
Can't
Buy

)
.
After
World
War
II
,
Burmese
cinema
continued
to
address
political
themes
.
Many
of
the
films
produced
in
the
early

Switzerland
(
/

/
)
,
officially
the
Swiss
Confederation
(
Latin
:
Confoederatio
Helvetica
,
hence
its
abbreviation
CH
)
,
is
a
country
in
Europe
.
While
still
named
the
"
Swiss
Confederation
"
for
historical
reasons
,
modern
Switzerland
is
a
federal
directorial
republic
consisting
of
26
cantons
,
with
Bern
as
the
seat
of
the
federal
authorities
,
called
Bundesstadt
(
"
federal
city
"
)
.
[
note

The
country
is
situated
in
Western
and
Central
Europe
,
[
note

]
and
is
bordered
by
Italy
to
the
south
,
France
to
the
west
,
Germany
to
the
north
,
and
Austria
and
Liechtenstein
to
the
east
.
Switzerland
is
a
landlocked
country
geographically
divided
between
the
Alps
,
the
Swiss
Plateau
and
the
Jura
,
spanning
an
area
of
41,285
km2
(
15,940
sq
mi
)
.
While
the
Alps
occupy
the
greater
part
of
the
territory
,
the
Swiss
population
of
approximately
8
million
people
is
concentrated
mostly
on
the
Plateau
,
where
the
largest
cities
are
to
be
found
:
among
them
are
the
two
global
and
economic
centres
,
Zürich
and
Geneva
.
The
establishment
of
the
Swiss
Confederation
is
traditionally
dated
to
1
August
1291
,
which
is
celebrated
annually
as
the
Swiss
National
Day
.
The
country
has
a
long
history
of
armed
neutrality
—
it
has
not
been
in
a
state
of
war
internationally
since
1815
—
and
did
not
join
the
United
Nations
until
2002
.
Nevertheless
,
it
pursues
an
active
foreign
policy
and
is
frequently
involved
in
peace-
building
processes
around
the
world
.
In
addition
to
being
the
birthplace
of
the
Red
Cross
,
Switzerland
is
home
to
numerous
international
organizations
,
including
the
second
largest
UN
office
.
On
the
European
level
,
it
is
a
founding
member
of
the
European
Free
Trade
Association
,
but
notably
it
is
not
part
of
the
European
Union
,
nor
the
European
Economic
Area
.
However
the
country
does
participate
in
the
Schengen
Area
and
the
EU
's
single
market
through
a
number
of
bilateral
treaties
.
Straddling
the
intersection
of
Germanic
and
Romance
Europe
,
Switzerland
comprises
four
main
linguistic
and
cultural
regions
:
German
,
French
,
Italian
and
Romansh
.
Therefore
,
the
Swiss
,
although
predominantly
German-speaking
,
do
not
form
a
nation
in
the
sense
of
a
common
ethnicity
or
language
;
rather
,
Switzerland
's
strong
sense
of
identity
and
community
is
founded
on
a
common
historical
background
,
shared
values
such
as
federalism
and
direct
democracy

Switzerland
is
one
of
the
richest
and
wealthiest
countries
in
the
world
.
Switzerland
ranks
top
or
close
to
the
top
in
several
metrics
of
national
performance
,
including
government
transparency
,
civil
liberties
,
quality
of
life
,
economic
competitiveness
,
and
human
development
.
It
has
the
highest
nominal
wealth
(
financial
and
non-financial
assets
)
per
adult
in
the
world
according
to
Credit
Suisse
and
the
eighth-
highest
per
capita
gross
domestic
product
on
the
IMF
list
.
Zürich
and
Geneva
have
each
been
ranked
among
the
top
cities
with
the
highest
quality
of
life
in
the
world
,
with
the
former
ranked
2nd
globally
,
according
to
Mercer
.
The
English
name
Switzerland
is
a
compound
containing
Switzer
,
an
obsolete
term
for
the
Swiss
,
which
was
in
use
during
the
16th
to
19th
centuries
.
The
English
adjective
Swiss
is
a
loan
from
French
Suisse
,
also
in
use
since
the
16th
century
.
The
name
Switzer
is
from
the
Alemannic
Schwiizer
,
in
origin
an
inhabitant
of
Schwyz
and
its
associated
territory
,
one
of
the
Waldstätten
cantons
which
formed
the
nucleus
of
the
Old
Swiss
Confederacy
.
The
name
originates
as
an
exonym
,
applied
pars
pro
toto
to
the
troops
of
the
Confederacy
.
The
Swiss
began
to
adopt
the
name
for
themselves
after
the
Swabian
War
of
1499
,
used
alongside
the
term
for
"
Confederates
"
,
Eidgenossen
(
literally
:
comrades
by
oath
)
,
used
since
the
14th
century
.
The
toponym
Schwyz
itself
is
first
attested
in
972
,
as
Old
High
German
Suittes
,
ultimately
perhaps
related
to
suedan
"
to
burn
"
,
referring
to
the
area
of
forest
that
was
burned
and
cleared
to
build
.
The
name
was
extended
to
the
area
dominated
by
the
canton
,
and
after
the
Swabian
War
of
1499
gradually
came
to
be
used
for
the
entire
Confederation
.
The
Swiss
German
name
of
the
country
,
Schwiiz
,
is
homophonous
to
that
of
the
canton
and
the
settlement
,
but
distinguished
by
the
use
of
the
definite
article
(
d'
Schwiiz
for
the
Confederation
,
but
simply
Schwyz
for
the
canton
and
the
town
)
.
The
earliest
known
cultural
tribes
of
the
area
were
members
of
the
Hallstatt
and
La
Tène
cultures
,
named
after
the
archaeological
site
of
La
Tène
on
the
north
side
of
Lake
Neuchâtel
.
La
Tène
culture
developed
and
flourished
during
the
late
Iron
Age
from
around
450
BC
,
possibly
under
some
influence
from
the
Greek
and
Etruscan
civilisations
.
One
of
the
most
important
tribal
groups
in
the
Swiss
region
was
the
Helvetii
.
Steadily
harassed
by
the
Germans
,
in
58
BC
the
Helvetii
decided
to
abandon
the
Swiss
plateau
and
migrate
to
western
Gallia
,
but
Julius
Caesar
's
armies
pursued
and
defeated
them
at
the
Battle
of
Bibracte
,
in
today
's
western
France
,
forcing
the
tribe
to
move
back
to
its
original
homeland
.
In
15
BC
,
Tiberius
,
who
was
destined
to
be
the
second
Roman
emperor
and
his
brother
,
Drusus
,
conquered
the
Alps
,
integrating
them
into
the
Roman
Empire
.
The
area
occupied
by
the
Helvetii
—
the
namesakes
of
the
later
Confoederatio
Helvetica
—
first
became
part
of
Rome
's
Gallia
Belgica
province
and
then
of
its
Germania
Superior
province
,
while
the
eastern
portion
of
modern
Switzerland
was
integrated
into
the
Roman
province
of
Raetia
.
Sometime
around
the
start
of
the
Common
Era
,
the
Romans
maintained
a
large
legionary
camp
called
Vindonissa
,
now
a
ruin
at
the
confluence
of
the
Aare
and
Reuss
rivers
,
near
the
town
of
Windisch
,
an
outskirt
of
Brugg
.
In
about
260
AD
,
the
fall
of
the
Agri
Decumates
territory
north
of
the
Rhine
transformed
today
's
Switzerland
into
a
frontier
land
of
the
Empire
.
Repeated
raids
by
the
Alamanni
tribes
provoked
the
ruin
of
the
Roman
towns
and
economy
,
forcing
the
population
to
find
shelter
near
Roman
fortresses
,
like
the
Castrum
Rauracense
near
Augusta
Raurica
.
The
Empire
built
another
line
of
defense
at
the
north
border
(
the
so-called
Donau-Iller
-
Rhine
-
Limes
)
,
but
at
the
end
of
the
fourth
century
the
increased
Germanic
pressure
forced
the
Romans
to
abandon
the
linear
defence
concept
,
and
the
Swiss
plateau
was
finally
open
to
the
settlement
of
German
tribes
.
In
the
Early
Middle
Ages
,
from
the
end
of
the
4th
century
,
the
western
extent
of
modern-
day
Switzerland
was
part
of
the
territory
of
the
Kings
of
the
Burgundians
.
The
Alemanni
settled
the
Swiss
plateau
in
the
5th
century
and
the
valleys
of
the
Alps
in
the
8th
century
,
forming
Alemannia
.
Modern-day
Switzerland
was
therefore
then
divided
between
the
kingdoms
of
Alemannia
and
Burgundy
.
The
entire
region
became
part
of
the
expanding
Frankish
Empire
in
the
6th
century
,
following
Clovis
I
's
victory
over
the
Alemanni
at
Tolbiac
in
504
AD
,
and
later
Frankish
domination
of
the
Burgundians
.
By
1200
,
the
Swiss
plateau
comprised
the
dominions
of
the
houses
of
Savoy
,
Zähringer
,
Habsburg
,
and
Kyburg
.
Some
regions
(
Uri
,
Schwyz
,
Unterwalden
,
later
known
as
Waldstätten
)
were
accorded
the
Imperial
immediacy
to
grant
the
empire
direct
control
over
the
mountain
passes
.
With
the
extinction
of
its
male
line
in
1263
the
Kyburg
dynasty
fell
in
AD
1264
;
then
the
Habsburgs
under
King
Rudolph
I
(
Holy
Roman
Emperor
in
1273
)
laid
claim
to
the
Kyburg
lands
and
annexed
them
extending
their
territory
to
the
eastern
Swiss
plateau
.
By
1353
,
the
three
original
cantons
had
joined
with
the
cantons
of
Glarus
and
Zug
and
the
Lucerne
,
Zürich
and
Bern
city
states
to
form
the
"
Old
Confederacy
"
of
eight
states
that
existed
until
the
end
of
the
15th
century
.
The
expansion
led
to
increased
power
and
wealth
for
the
federation
.
By
1460
,
the
confederates
controlled
most
of
the
territory
south
and
west
of
the
Rhine
to
the
Alps
and
the
Jura
mountains
,
particularly
after
victories
against
the
Habsburgs
(
Battle
of
Sempach
,
Battle
of
Näfels
)
,
over
Charles
the
Bold
of
Burgundy
during
the
1470s
,
and
the
success
of
the
Swiss
mercenaries
.
The
Swiss
victory
in
the
Swabian
War
against
the
Swabian
League
of
Emperor
Maximilian
I
in
1499
amounted
to
de
facto
independence
within
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
.
The
Old
Swiss
Confederacy
had
acquired
a
reputation
of
invincibility
during
these
earlier
wars
,
but
expansion
of
the
federation
suffered
a
setback
in
1515
with
the
Swiss
defeat
in
the
Battle
of
Marignano
.
This
ended
the
so-called
"
heroic
"
epoch
of
Swiss
history
.
The
success
of
Zwingli's
Reformation
in
some
cantons
led
to
inter-cantonal
religious
conflicts
in
1529
and
1531
(
Wars
of
Kappel
)
.
It
was
not
until
more
than
one
hundred
years
after
these
internal
wars
that
,
in
1648
,
under
the
Peace
of
Westphalia
,
European
countries
recognized
Switzerland
's
independence
from
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
and
its
neutrality
.
In
1798
,
the
revolutionary
French
government
conquered
Switzerland
and
imposed
a
new
unified
constitution
.
This
centralised
the
government
of
the
country
,
effectively
abolishing
the
cantons
:
moreover
,
Mülhausen
joined
France
and
Valtellina
valley
,
the
Cisalpine
Republic
,
separating
from
Switzerland
.
The
new
regime
,
known
as
the
Helvetic
Republic
,
was
highly
unpopular
.
It
had
been
imposed
by
a
foreign
invading
army
and
destroyed
centuries
of
tradition
,
making
Switzerland
nothing
more
than
a
French
satellite
state
.
The
fierce
French
suppression
of
the
Nidwalden
Revolt
in
September
1798
was
an
example
of
the
oppressive
presence
of
the
French
Army
and
the
local
population
's
resistance
to
the
occupation
.
When
war
broke
out
between
France
and
its
rivals
,
Russian
and
Austrian
forces
invaded
Switzerland
.
The
Swiss
refused
to
fight
alongside
the
French
in
the
name
of
the
Helvetic
Republic
.
In
1803
Napoleon
organised
a
meeting
of
the
leading
Swiss
politicians
from
both
sides
in
Paris
.
The
result
was
the
Act
of
Mediation
which
largely
restored
Swiss
autonomy
and
introduced
a
Confederation
of
19
cantons
.
Henceforth
,
much
of
Swiss
politics
would
concern
balancing
the
cantons
'
tradition
of
self-rule
with
the
need
for
a
central
government
.
The
restoration
of
power
to
the
patriciate
was
only
temporary
.
After
a
period
of
unrest
with
repeated
violent
clashes
such
as
the
Züriputsch
of
1839
,
civil
war
(
the
Sonderbundskrieg
)
broke
out
in
1847
when
some
Catholic
cantons
tried
to
set
up
a
separate
alliance
(
the
Sonderbund
)
.
The
war
lasted
for
less
than
a
month
,
causing
fewer
than
100
casualties
,
most
of
which
were
through
friendly
fire
.
Yet
however
minor
the
Sonderbundskrieg
appears
compared
with
other
European
riots
and
wars
in
the
19th
century
,
it
nevertheless
had
a
major
impact
on
both
the
psychology
and
the
society
of
the
Swiss
and
of
Switzerland
.
Thus
,
while
the
rest
of
Europe
saw
revolutionary
uprisings
,
the
Swiss
drew
up
a
constitution
which
provided
for
a
federal
layout
,
much
of
it
inspired
by
the
American
example
.
This
constitution
provided
for
a
central
authority
while
leaving
the
cantons
the
right
to
self-
government
on
local
issues
.
Giving
credit
to
those
who
favoured
the
power
of
the
cantons
(
the
Sonderbund
Kantone
)
,
the
national
assembly
was
divided
between
an
upper
house
(
the
Council
of
States
,
two
representatives
per
canton
)
and
a
lower
house
(
the
National
Council
,
with
representatives
elected
from
across
the
country
)
.
Referenda
were
made
mandatory
for
any
amendment
of
this
constitution
.
During
World
War
II
,
detailed
invasion
plans
were
drawn
up
by
the
Germans
,
but
Switzerland
was
never
attacked
.
Switzerland
was
able
to
remain
independent
through
a
combination
of
military
deterrence
,
concessions
to
Germany
,
and
good
fortune
as
larger
events
during
the
war
delayed
an
invasion
.
Under
General
Henri
Guisan
central
command
,
a
general
mobilisation
of
the
armed
forces
was
ordered
.
The
Swiss
military
strategy
was
changed
from
one
of
static
defence
at
the
borders
to
protect
the
economic
heartland
,
to
one
of
organised
long-term
attrition
and
withdrawal
to
strong
,
well
-
stockpiled
positions
high
in
the
Alps
known
as
the
Reduit
.
Switzerland
was
an
important
base
for
espionage
by
both
sides
in
the
conflict
and
often
mediated
communications
between
the
Axis
and
Allied
powers
.
Switzerland
's
trade
was
blockaded
by
both
the
Allies
and
by
the
Axis
.
Economic
cooperation
and
extension
of
credit
to
the
Third
Reich
varied
according
to
the
perceived
likelihood
of
invasion
and
the
availability
of
other
trading
partners
.
Concessions
reached
a
peak
after
a
crucial
rail
link
through
Vichy
France
was
severed
in
1942
,
leaving
Switzerland
completely
surrounded
by
the
Axis
.
Over
the
course
of
the
war
,
Switzerland
interned
over
300,000
refugees
and
the
International
Red
Cross
,
based
in
Geneva
,
played
an
important
part
during
the
conflict
.
Strict
immigration
and
asylum
policies
as
well
as
the
financial
relationships
with
Nazi
Germany
raised
controversy
,
but
not
until
the
end
of
the
20th
century
.
Switzerland
was
the
last
Western
republic
to
grant
women
the
right
to
vote
.
Some
Swiss
cantons
approved
this
in
1959
,
while
at
the
federal
level
it
was
achieved
in
1971
and
,
after
resistance
,
in
the
last
canton
Appenzell
Innerrhoden
(
one
of
only
two
remaining
Landsgemeinde
)
in
1990
.
After
obtaining
suffrage
at
the
federal
level
,
women
quickly
rose
in
political
significance
,
with
the
first
woman
on
the
seven
member
Federal
Council
executive
being
Elisabeth
Kopp
,
who
served
from
1984
–
1989
,
and
the
first
female
president
being
Ruth
Dreifuss
in
1999
.
In
2002
Switzerland
became
a
full
member
of
the
United
Nations
,
leaving
the
Vatican
City
as
the
last
widely
recognised
state
without
full
UN
membership
.
Switzerland
is
a
founding
member
of
the
EFTA
,
but
is
not
a
member
of
the
European
Economic
Area
.
An
application
for
membership
in
the
European
Union
was
sent
in
May
1992
,
but
not
advanced
since
the
EEA
was
rejected
in
December
1992
when
Switzerland
was
the
only
country
to
launch
a
referendum
on
the
EEA
.
There
have
since
been
several
referenda
on
the
EU
issue
;
due
to
a
mixed
reaction
from
the
population
the
membership
application
has
been
frozen
.
Nonetheless
,
Swiss
law
is
gradually
being
adjusted
to
conform
with
that
of
the
EU
,
and
the
government
has
signed
a
number
of
bilateral
agreements
with
the
European
Union
.
Switzerland
,
together
with
Liechtenstein
,
has
been
completely
surrounded
by
the
EU
since
Austria
's
entry
in
1995
.
On
5
June
2005
,
Swiss
voters
agreed
by
a
55
%
majority
to
join
the
Schengen
treaty
,
a
result
that
was
regarded
by
EU
commentators
as
a
sign
of
support
by
Switzerland
,
a
country
that
is
traditionally
perceived
as
independent
and
reluctant
to
enter
supranational
bodies
.
Extending
across
the
north
and
south
side
of
the
Alps
in
west-central
Europe
,
Switzerland
encompasses
a
great
diversity
of
landscapes
and
climates
on
a
limited
area
of
41,285
square
kilometres
(
15,940
sq
mi
)
.
The
population
is
about
8
million
,
resulting
in
an
average
population
density
of
around
195
people
per
square
kilometre
(
500
/
sq
m
i
)
.
The
more
mountainous
southern
half
of
the
country
is
far
more
sparsely
populated
than
the
northern
half
.
In
the
largest
Canton
of
Graubünden
,
lying
entirely
in
the
Alps
,
population
density
falls
to
27
/
km²
(
70
/
sq
mi
)
.
Switzerland
lies
between
latitudes
45°
and
48°
N
,
and
longitudes
5°
and
11°
E
.
It
contains
three
basic
topographical
areas
:
the
Swiss
Alps
to
the
south
,
the
Swiss
Plateau
or
Central
Plateau
,
and
the
Jura
mountains
on
the
west
.
The
Alps
are
a
high
mountain
range
running
across
the
central
-
south
of
the
country
,
comprising
about
60
%
of
the
country
's
total
area
.
The
majority
of
the
Swiss
population
live
in
the
Swiss
Plateau
.
Among
the
high
valleys
of
the
Swiss
Alps
many
glaciers
are
found
,
totalling
an
area
of
1,063
square
kilometres
(
410
sq
mi
)
.
From
these
originate
the
headwaters
of
several
major
rivers
,
such
as
the
Rhine
,
Inn
,
Ticino
and
Rhône
,
which
flow
in
the
four
cardinal
directions
into
the
whole
of
Europe
.
The
hydrographic
network
includes
several
of
the
largest
bodies
of
freshwater
in
Central
and
Western
Europe
,
among
which
are
included
Lake
Geneva
(
also
called

,
Lake
Constance
(
known

Bodensee

and
Lake

.
Switzerland
has
more
than
1500
lakes
,
and
contains
6
%
of
Europe
's
stock
of
fresh
water
.
Lakes
and
glaciers
cover
about
6
%
of
the
national
territory
.
The
largest
lake
is
Lake
Geneva
,
in
western
Switzerland
shared
with
France
.
The
Rhône
is
both
the
main
source
and
outflow
of
Lake
Geneva
.
Lake
Constance
is
the
second
largest
Swiss
lake
and
,
like
the
Lake
Geneva
,
an
intermediate
step
by
the
Rhine
at
the
border
to
Austria
and
Germany
.
While
the
Rhône
flows
into
the
Mediterranean
Sea
at
the
French
Camarque
region
and
the
Rhine
flows
into
the
North
Sea
at
Rotterdam
in
the
Netherlands
,
about
1000
km
apart
,
both
springs
are
only
about
22
km
apart
from
each
other
in
the
Swiss
Alps
.
48
of
Switzerland
's
mountains
are
4,000
metres
(
13,000
ft
)
above
sea
in
altitude
or
higher
.
At
4,634
m
(
15,203
ft
)
,
Monte
Rosa
is
the
highest
,
although
the
Matterhorn
(
4,478
m
or
14,692
ft
)
is
often
regarded
as
the
most
famous
.
Both
are
located
within
the
Pennine
Alps
in
the
canton
of
Valais
.
The
section
of
the
Bernese
Alps
above
the
deep
glacial
Lauterbrunnen
valley
,
containing
72
waterfalls
,
is
well
known
for
the
Jungfrau
(
4,158
m
or
13,642
ft
)
Eiger
and
Mönch
,
and
the
many
picturesque
valleys
in
the
region
.
In
the
southeast
the
long
Engadin
Valley
,
encompassing
the
St.
Moritz
area
in
canton
of
Graubünden
,
is
also
well
known
;
the
highest
peak
in
the
neighbouring
Bernina
Alps
is
Piz
Bernina
(
4,049
m
or
13,284
ft
)
.
The
Swiss
climate
is
generally
temperate
,
but
can
vary
greatly
between
the
localities
,
from
glacial
conditions
on
the
mountaintops
to
the
often
pleasant
near
Mediterranean
climate
at
Switzerland
's
southern
tip
.
There
are
some
valley
areas
in
the
southern
part
of
Switzerland
where
some
cold
-hardy
palm
trees
are
found
.
Summers
tend
to
be
warm
and
humid
at
times
with
periodic
rainfall
so
they
are
ideal
for
pastures
and
grazing
.
The
less
humid
winters
in
the
mountains
may
see
long
intervals
of
stable
conditions
for
weeks
,
while
the
lower
lands
tend
to
suffer
from
inversion
,
during
these
periods
,
thus
seeing
no
sun
for
weeks
.
A
weather
phenomenon
known
as
the
föhn
(
with
an
identical
effect
to
the
chinook
wind
)
can
occur
at
all
times
of
the
year
and
is
characterised
by
an
unexpectedly
warm
wind
,
bringing
air
of
very
low
relative
humidity
to
the
north
of
the
Alps
during
rainfall
periods
on
the
southern
face
of
the
Alps
.
This
works
both
ways
across
the
alps
but
is
more
efficient
if
blowing
from
the
south
due
to
the
steeper
step
for
oncoming
wind
from
the
south
.
Valleys
running
south
to
north
trigger
the
best
effect
.
The
driest
conditions
persist
in
all
inner
alpine
valleys
that
receive
less
rain
because
arriving
clouds
lose
a
lot
of
their
content
while
crossing
the
mountains
before
reaching
these
areas
.
Large
alpine
areas
such
as
Graubünden
remain
drier
than
pre-alpine
areas
and
as
in
the
main
valley
of
the
Valais
wine
grapes
are
grown
there
.
Switzerland
's
ecosystems
can
be
particularly
fragile
,
because
the
many
delicate
valleys
separated
by
high
mountains
often
form
unique
ecologies
.
The
mountainous
regions
themselves
are
also
vulnerable
,
with
a
rich
range
of
plants
not
found
at
other
altitudes
,
and
experience
some
pressure
from
visitors
and
grazing
.
The
climatic
,
geological
and
topographical
conditions
of
the
alpine
region
make
for
a
very
fragile
ecosystem
that
is
particularly
sensitive
to
climate
change
.
Nevertheless
,
according
to
the
2014
Environmental
Performance
Index
,
Switzerland
ranks
first
among
132
nations
in
safeguarding
the
environment
,
due
to
its
high
scores
on
environmental
public
health
,
its
heavy
reliance
on
renewable
sources
of
energy
(
hydropower
and
geothermal
energy
)
,
and
its
control
of
greenhouse
gas
emissions
.
The
Federal
Constitution
adopted
in
1848
is
the
legal
foundation
of
the
modern
federal
state
.
It
is
among
the
oldest
constitutions
in
the
world
.
A
new
Constitution
was
adopted
in
1999
,
but
did
not
introduce
notable
changes
to
the
federal
structure
.
It
outlines
basic
and
political
rights
of
individuals
and
citizen
participation
in
public
affairs
,
divides
the
powers
between
the
Confederation
and
the
cantons
and
defines
federal
jurisdiction
and
authority
.
There
are
three
main
governing
bodies
on
the
federal
level
:
the
bicameral
parliament
(
legislative
)
,
the
Federal
Council
(
executive
)
and
the
Federal
Court
(
judicial
)
.
The
Swiss
Parliament
consists
of
two
houses
:
the
Council
of
States
which
has
46
representatives
(
two
from
each
canton
and
one
from
each
half
-
canton
)
who
are
elected
under
a
system
determined
by
each
canton
,
and
the
National
Council
,
which
consists
of
200
members
who
are
elected
under
a
system
of
proportional
representation
,
depending
on
the
population
of
each
canton
.
Members
of
both
houses
serve
for
4
years
.
When
both
houses
are
in
joint
session
,
they
are
known
collectively
as
the
Federal
Assembly
.
Through
referendums
,
citizens
may
challenge
any
law
passed
by
parliament
and
through
initiatives
,
introduce
amendments
to
the
federal
constitution
,
thus
making
Switzerland
a
direct
democracy
.
The
Federal
Council
constitutes
the
federal
government
,
directs
the
federal
administration
and
serves
as
collective
Head
of
State
.
It
is
a
collegial
body
of
seven
members
,
elected
for
a
four-year
mandate
by
the
Federal
Assembly
which
also
exercises
oversight
over
the
Council
.
The
President
of
the
Confederation
is
elected
by
the
Assembly
from
among
the
seven
members
,
traditionally
in
rotation
and
for
a
one
-
year
term
;
the
President
chairs
the
government
and
assumes
representative
functions
.
However
,
the
president
is
a
primus
inter
pares
with
no
additional
powers
,
and
remains
the
head
of
a
department
within
the
administration
.
Direct
democracy
and
federalism
are
hallmarks
of
the
Swiss
political
system
.
Swiss
citizens
are
subject
to
three
legal
jurisdictions
:
the
commune
,
canton
and
federal
levels
.
The
1848
federal
constitution
defines
a
system
of
direct
democracy
(
sometimes
called
half
-
direct
or
representative
direct
democracy
because
it
is
aided
by
the
more
commonplace
institutions
of
a
representative
democracy
)
.
The
instruments
of
this
system
at
the
federal
level
,
known
as
civic
rights
(
Volksrechte
,
droits
civiques
)
,
include
the
right
to
submit
a
constitutional
initiative
and
a
referendum
,
both
of
which
may
overturn
parliamentary
decisions
.
Similarly
,
the
federal
constitutional
initiative
allows
citizens
to
put
a
constitutional
amendment
to
a
national
vote
,
if
100,000
voters
sign
the
proposed
amendment
within
18
months
.
[
note
8
]
Parliament
can
supplement
the
proposed
amendment
with
a
counter
-proposal
,
and
then
voters
must
indicate
a
preference
on
the
ballot
in
case
both
proposals
are
accepted
.
Constitutional
amendments
,
whether
introduced
by
initiative
or
in
Parliament
,
must
be
accepted
by
a
double
majority
of
the
national
popular
vote
and
the
cantonal
popular
votes
.
[
note
9
]
The
cantons
have
a
permanent
constitutional
status
and
,
in
comparison
with
the
situation
in
other
countries
,
a
high
degree
of
independence
.
Under
the
Federal
Constitution
,
all
26
cantons
are
equal
in
status
.
Each
canton
has
its
own
constitution
,
and
its
own
parliament
,
government
and
courts
.
However
,
there
are
considerable
differences
between
the
individual
cantons
,
most
particularly
in
terms
of
population
and
geographical
area
.
Their
populations
vary
between
15,000
(
Appenzell
Innerrhoden
)
and
1,253,500
(
Zürich
)
,
and
their
area
between
37
km2
(
14
sq
mi
)
(
Basel
-
Stadt
)
and
7,105
km2
(
2,743
sq
mi
)
(
Graubünden
)
.
The
Cantons
comprise
a
total
of
2,485
municipalities
.
Within
Switzerland
there
are
two
enclaves
:
Büsingen
belongs
to
Germany
,
Campione
d'Italia
belongs
to
Italy
.
Traditionally
,
Switzerland
avoids
alliances
that
might
entail
military
,
political
,
or
direct
economic
action
and
has
been
neutral
since
the
end
of
its
expansion
in
1515
.
Its
policy
of
neutrality
was
internationally
recognised
at
the
Congress
of
Vienna
in
1815
.
Only
in
2002
did
Switzerland
become
a
full
member
of
the
United
Nations
and
it
was
the
first
state
to
join
it
by
referendum
.
Switzerland
maintains
diplomatic
relations
with
almost
all
countries
and
historically
has
served
as
an
intermediary
between
other
states
.
Switzerland
is
not
a
member
of
the
European
Union
;
the
Swiss
people
have
consistently
rejected
membership
since
the
early
1990s
.
However
,
Switzerland
does
participate
in
the
Schengen
Area
.
A
large
number
of
international
institutions
have
their
seats
in
Switzerland
,
in
part
because
of
its
policy
of
neutrality
.
Geneva
is
the
birthplace
of
the
Red
Cross
and
Red
Crescent
Movement
and
the
Geneva
Conventions
and
,
since
2006
,
hosts
the
United
Nations
Human
Rights
Council
.
Even
though
Switzerland
is
one
of
the
most
recent
countries
to
have
joined
the
United
Nations
,
the
Palace
of
Nations
in
Geneva
is
the
second
biggest
centre
for
the
United
Nations
after
New
York
,
and
Switzerland
was
a
founding
member
and
home
to
the
League
of
Nations
.
Apart
from
the
United
Nations
headquarters
,
the
Swiss
Confederation
is
host
to
many
UN
agencies
,
like
the
World
Health
Organization
(
WHO
)
,
the
International
Labour
Organization
(
ILO
)
,
the
International
Telecommunication
Union
(
ITU
)
,
the
United
Nations
High
Commissioner
for
Refugees
(
UNHCR
)
and
about
200
other
international
organisations
,
including
the
World
Trade
Organization
and
the
World
Intellectual
Property
Organization
.
The
annual
meetings
of
the
World
Economic
Forum
in
Davos
bring
together
top
international
business
and
political
leaders
from
Switzerland
and
foreign
countries
to
discuss
important
issues
facing
the
world
,
including
health
and
the
environment
.
Additionally
the
headquarters
of
the
Bank
for
International
Settlements
(
BIS
)
are
located
in
Basel
since
1930
.
The
structure
of
the
Swiss
militia
system
stipulates
that
the
soldiers
keep
their
Army
issued
equipment
,
including
all
personal
weapons
,
at
home
.
Some
organizations
and
political
parties
find
this
practice
controversial
but
mainstream
Swiss
opinion
is
in
favour
of
the
system
.
Compulsory
military
service
concerns
all
male
Swiss
citizens
;
women
can
serve
voluntarily
.
Men
usually
receive
military
conscription
orders
for
training
at
the
age
of
18
.
About
two
thirds
of
the
young
Swiss
are
found
suited
for
service
;
for
those
found
unsuited
,
various
forms
of
alternative
service
exist
.
Annually
,
approximately
20,000
persons
are
trained
in
recruit
centres
for
a
duration
from
18
to
21
weeks
.
The
reform
"
Army
XXI
"
was
adopted
by
popular
vote
in
2003
,
it
replaced
the
previous
model
"
Army
95
"
,
reducing
the
effectives
from
400,000
to
about
200,000
.
Of
those
,
120,000
are
active
in
periodic
Army
training
and
80,000
are
non-training
reserves
.
Switzerland
has
a
stable
,
prosperous
and
high-
tech
economy
and
enjoys
great
wealth
,
being
ranked
as
the
wealthiest
country
in
the
world
per
capita
in
multiple
rankings
.
In
2011
it
was
ranked
as
the
wealthiest
country
in
the
world
in
per
capita
terms
(
with
"
wealth
"
being
defined
to
include
both
financial
and
non-financial
assets
)
,
while
the
2013
Credit
Suisse
Global
Wealth
Report
showed
that
Switzerland
was
the
country
with
the
highest
average
wealth
per
adult
in
2013
.
It
has
the
world
's
nineteenth
largest
economy
by
nominal
GDP
and
the
thirty
-
sixth
largest
by
purchasing
power
parity
.
It
is
the
twentieth
largest
exporter
,
despite
its
small
size
.
Switzerland
has
the
highest
European
rating
in
the
Index
of
Economic
Freedom
2010
,
while
also
providing
large
coverage
through
public
services
.
The
nominal
per
capita
GDP
is
higher
than
those
of
the
larger
Western
and
Central
European
economies
and
Japan
.
If
adjusted
for
purchasing
power
parity
,
Switzerland
ranks
8th
in
the
world
in
terms
of
GDP
per
capita
,
according
to
the
World
Bank
and
IMF
(
ranked
15th
according
to
the
CIA
Worldfactbook
)
.
The
World
Economic
Forum
's
Global
Competitiveness
Report
currently
ranks
Switzerland
's
economy
as
the
most
competitive
in
the
world
,
while
ranked
by
the
European
Union
as
Europe
's
most
innovative
country
.
For
much
of
the
20th
century
,
Switzerland
was
the
wealthiest
country
in
Europe
by
a
considerable
margin
(
by
GDP
–
per
capita
)
.
In
2007
the
gross
median
household
income
in
Switzerland
was
an
estimated
137,094
USD
at
Purchasing
power
parity
while
the
median
income
was
95,824
USD
.
Switzerland
also
has
one
of
the
world
's
largest
account
balances
as
a
percentage
of
GDP
.
Switzerland
's
most
important
economic
sector
is
manufacturing
.
Manufacturing
consists
largely
of
the
production
of
specialist
chemicals
,
health
and
pharmaceutical
goods
,
scientific
and
precision
measuring
instruments
and
musical
instruments
.
The
largest
exported
goods
are
chemicals
(
34
%
of
exported
goods
)
,
machines
/
electronics
(
20.9
%
)
,
and
precision
instruments
/
watches
(
16.9
%
)
.
Exported
services
amount
to
a
third
of
exports
.
The
service
sector
–
especially
banking
and
insurance
,
tourism
,
and
international
organisations
–
is
another
important
industry
for
Switzerland
.
Around
3.8
million
people
work
in
Switzerland
;
about
25
%
of
employees
belonged
to
a
trade
union
in
2004
.
Switzerland
has
a
more
flexible
job
market
than
neighbouring
countries
and
the
unemployment
rate
is
very
low
.
The
unemployment
rate
increased
from
a
low
of
1.7
%
in
June
2000
to
a
peak
of
4.4
%
in
December
2009
.
The
unemployment
rate
is
3.2
%
in
2014
.
Population
growth
from
net
immigration
is
quite
high
,
at
0.52
%
of
population
in
2004
.
The
foreign
citizen
population
was
21.8
%
in
2004
,
about
the
same
as
in
Australia
.
GDP
per
hour
worked
is
the
world
's
16th
highest
,
at
49.46
international
dollars
in
2012
.
Switzerland
has
an
overwhelmingly
private
sector
economy
and
low
tax
rates
by
Western
World
standards
;
overall
taxation
is
one
of
the
smallest
of
developed
countries
.
Switzerland
is
a
relatively
easy
place
to
do
business
,
currently
ranking
20th
of
189
countries
in
the
Ease
of
Doing
Business
Index
.
The
slow
growth
Switzerland
experienced
in
the
1990s
and
the
early
2000s
has
brought
greater
support
for
economic
reforms
and
harmonization
with
the
European
Union
.
According
to
Credit
Suisse
,
only
about
37
%
of
residents
own
their
own
homes
,
one
of
the
lowest
rates
of
home
ownership
in
Europe
.
Housing
and
food
price
levels
were
171
%
and
145
%
of
the
EU
-
25
index
in
2007
,
compared
to
113
%
and
104
%
in
Germany
.
The
Swiss
Federal
budget
had
a
size
of
62.8
billion
Swiss
francs
in
2010
,
which
is
an
equivalent
11.35
%
of
the
country
's
GDP
in
that
year
;
however
,
the
regional
(
canton
)
budgets
and
the
budgets
of
the
municipalities
are
not
counted
as
part
of
the
federal
budget
and
the
total
rate
of
government
spending
is
closer
to
33.8
%
of
GDP
.
The
main
sources
of
income
for
the
federal
government
are
the
value-added
tax
(
33
%
)
and
the
direct
federal
tax
(
29
%
)
and
the
main
expenditure
is
located
in
the
areas
of
social
welfare
and
finance
&
tax
.
The
expenditures
of
the
Swiss
Confederation
have
been
growing
from
7
%
of
GDP
in
1960
to
9.7
%
in
1990
and
to
10.7
%
in
2010
.
While
the
sectors
social
welfare
and
finance
&
tax
have
been
growing
from
35
%
in
1990
to
48.2
%
in
2010
,
a
significant
reduction
of
expenditures
has
been
occurring
in
the
sectors
of
agriculture
and
national
defense
;
from
26.5
%
in
to
12.4
%
(
estimation
for
the
year
2015
)
.
Agricultural
protectionism
—
a
rare
exception
to
Switzerland
's
free
trade
policies
—
has
contributed
to
high
food
prices
.
Product
market
liberalisation
is
lagging
behind
many
EU
countries
according
to
the
OECD
.
Nevertheless
,
domestic
purchasing
power
is
one
of
the
best
in
the
world
.
Apart
from
agriculture
,
economic
and
trade
barriers
between
the
European
Union
and
Switzerland
are
minimal
and
Switzerland
has
free
trade
agreements
worldwide
.
Switzerland
is
a
member
of
the
European
Free
Trade
Association
(
EFTA
)
.
Education
in
Switzerland
is
very
diverse
because
the
constitution
of
Switzerland
delegates
the
authority
for
the
school
system
to
the
cantons
.
There
are
both
public
and
private
schools
,
including
many
private
international
schools
.
The
minimum
age
for
primary
school
is
about
six
years
in
all
cantons
,
but
most
cantons
provide
a
free
"
children
's
school
"
starting
at
four
or
five
years
old
.
Primary
school
continues
until
grade
four
,
five
or
six
,
depending
on
the
school
.
Traditionally
,
the
first
foreign
language
in
school
was
always
one
of
the
other
national
languages
,
although
recently
(
2000
)
English
was
introduced
first
in
a
few
cantons
.
There
are
12
universities
in
Switzerland
,
ten
of
which
are
maintained
at
cantonal
level
and
usually
offer
a
range
of
non-technical
subjects
.
The
first
university
in
Switzerland
was
founded
in
1460
in
Basel
(
with
a
faculty
of
medicine
)
and
has
a
tradition
of
chemical
and
medical
research
in
Switzerland
.
The
biggest
university
in
Switzerland
is
the
University
of
Zurich
with
nearly
25,000
students
.
The
two
institutes
sponsored
by
the
federal
government
are
the
ETHZ
in
Zürich
(
founded
1855
)
and
the
EPFL
in
Lausanne
(
founded
1969
as
such
,
formerly
an
institute
associated
with
the
University
of
Lausanne
)
which
both
have
an
excellent
international
reputation
.

Many
Nobel
prizes
have
been
awarded
to
Swiss
scientists
,
for

to
the
world
-famous
physicist
Albert
Einstein
in
the
field
of
physics
who
developed
his
Special

In
total
,
113
Nobel
Prize
winners
in
all
fields
stand
in
relation
to
Switzerland
[

and
the
Nobel
Peace
Prize
has
been
awarded
nine
times
to
organisations
residing
in
Switzerland
.
Geneva
and
the
nearby
French
department
of
Ain
co-host
the
world
's
largest
laboratory
,
CERN
,
dedicated
to
particle
physics
research
.
Another
important
research
center
is
the
Paul
Scherrer
Institute
.
Notable
inventions
include
lysergic
acid
diethylamide
(
LSD
)
,
the
scanning
tunneling
microscope
(
Nobel
prize
)
and
Velcro
.
Some
technologies
enabled
the
exploration
of
new
worlds
such
as
the
pressurized
balloon
of
Auguste
Piccard
and
the
Bathyscaphe
which
permitted
Jacques
Piccard
to
reach
the
deepest
point
of
the
world
's
oceans
.
Switzerland
voted
against
membership
in
the
European
Economic
Area
in
a
referendum
in
December
1992
and
has
since
maintained
and
developed
its
relationships
with
the
European
Union
(
EU
)
and
European
countries
through
bilateral
agreements
.
In
March
2001
,
the
Swiss
people
refused
in
a
popular
vote
to
start
accession
negotiations
with
the
EU
.
In
recent
years
,
the
Swiss
have
brought
their
economic
practices
largely
into
conformity
with
those
of
the
EU
in
many
ways
,
in
an
effort
to
enhance
their
international
competitiveness
.
The
economy
grew
at
3
%
in
2010
,
1.9
%
in
2011
,
and
1
%
in
2012
.
Full
EU
membership
is
a
long-term
objective
of
some
in
the
Swiss
government
,
but
there
is
considerable
popular
sentiment
against
this
supported
by
the
conservative
SVP
party
.
The
western
French-
speaking
areas
and
the
urban
regions
of
the
rest
of
the
country
tend
to
be
more
pro-EU
,
however
with
far
from
any
significant
share
of
the
population
.
The
government
has
established
an
Integration
Office
under
the
Department
of
Foreign
Affairs
and
the
Department
of
Economic
Affairs
.
To
minimise
the
negative
consequences
of
Switzerland
's
isolation
from
the
rest
of
Europe
,
Bern
and
Brussels
signed
seven
bilateral
agreements
to
further
liberalise
trade
ties
.
These
agreements
were
signed
in
1999
and
took
effect
in
2001
.
This
first
series
of
bilateral
agreements
included
the
free
movement
of
persons
.
A
second
series
covering
nine
areas
was
signed
in
2004
and
has
since
been
ratified
,
which
includes
the
Schengen
Treaty
and
the
Dublin
Convention
besides
others
.
They
continue
to
discuss
further
areas
for
cooperation
.
In
2006
,
Switzerland
approved
1
billion
francs
of
supportive
investment
in
the
poorer
Southern
and
Central
European
countries
in
support
of
cooperation
and
positive
ties
to
the
EU
as
a
whole
.
A
further
referendum
will
be
needed
to
approve
300
million
francs
to
support
Romania
and
Bulgaria
and
their
recent
admission
.
The
Swiss
have
also
been
under
EU
and
sometimes
international
pressure
to
reduce
banking
secrecy
and
to
raise
tax
rates
to
parity
with
the
EU
.
Preparatory
discussions
are
being
opened
in
four
new
areas
:
opening
up
the
electricity
market
,
participation
in
the
European
GNSS
project
Galileo
,
cooperating
with
the
European
centre
for
disease
prevention
and
recognising
certificates
of
origin
for
food
products
.
On
9
February
2014
,
Swiss
voters
narrowly
approved
by
50.3
%
a
ballot
initiative
launched
by
the
national
conservative
Swiss
People
's
Party
(
SVP
/
UDC
)
to
restrict
immigration
,
and
thus
reintroducing
a
quota
system
on
the
influx
of
foreigners
.
This
initiative
was
mostly
backed
by
rural
(
57.6
%
approvals
)
,
suburban
(
51.2
%
approvals
)
,
and
isolated
cities
(
51.3
%
approvals
)
of
Switzerland
as
well
as
by
a
strong
majority
(
69.2
%
approval
)
in
the
canton
of
Ticino
,
while
metropolitan
centres
(
58.5
%
rejection
)
and
the
French-
speaking
part
(
58.5
%
rejection
)
of
Switzerland
rather
rejected
it
.
Some
news
commentators
claim
that
this
proposal
de
facto
contradicts
the
bilateral
agreements
on
the
free
movement
of
persons
from
these
respective
countries
.
The
former
ten-year
moratorium
on
the
construction
of
new
nuclear
power
plants
was
the
result
of
a
citizens
'
initiative
voted
on
in
1990
which
had
passed
with
54.5
%
Yes
vs.
45.5
%
No
votes
.
Plans
for
a
new
nuclear
plant
in
the
Canton
of
Bern
have
been
put
on
hold
after
the
accident
at
the
Fukushima
Daiichi
power
plant
in
2011
.
The
Swiss
Federal
Office
of
Energy
(
SFOE
)

energy
supply
and
energy
use
within
the
Federal
Department
of
Environment
,
Transport
,
Energy
and
Communications
(
DETEC

.
The
agency
is
supporting
the
2000
-
watt
society
initiative
to
cut
the
nation
's
energy
use
by
more
than
half
by
the
year
2050
.
On
25
May
2011
the
Swiss
government
announced
that
it
plans
to
end
its
use
of
nuclear
energy
in
the
next
2
or
3
decades
.
"
The
government
has
voted
for
a
phaseout
because
we
want
to
ensure
a
secure
and
autonomous
supply
of
energy
"
,
Energy
Minister
Doris
Leuthard
said
that
day
at
a
press
conference
in
Bern
.
"
Fukushima
showed
that
the
risk
of
nuclear
power
is
too
high
,
which
in
turn
has
also
increased
the
costs
of
this
energy
form
.
"
The
first
reactor
would
reportedly
be
taken
offline
in
2019
and
the
last
one
in
2034
.
Parliament
will
discuss
the
plan
in
June
2011
,
and
there
could
be
a
referendum
as
well
.
The
most
dense
rail
network
in
Europe
of
5,063
km
(
3,146
mi
)
carries
over
350
million
passengers
annually
.
In
2007
,
each
Swiss
citizen
travelled
on
average
2,258
km
(
1,403
mi
)
by
rail
,
which
makes
them
the
keenest
rail
users
.
The
network
is
administered
mainly
by
the
Federal
Railways
,
except
in
Graubünden
,
where
the
366
km
(
227
mi
)
narrow
gauge
railway
is
operated
by
the
Rhaetian
Railways
and
includes
some
World
Heritage
lines
.
The
building
of

Swiss
private-public
managed
road
network
is
funded
by
road
tolls
and
vehicle
taxes
.
The
Swiss
autobahn
/
autoroute
system
requires
the
purchase
of
a
vignette
(
toll
sticker
)
—
which
costs
40
Swiss
francs
—
for
one
calendar
year
in
order
to
use
its
roadways
,
for
both
passenger
cars
and

.
The
Swiss
autobahn
/
autoroute
network
has
a
total
length
of
1,638
km
(
1,018
mi
)
(
as
of
2000
)
and
has
,
by
an
area
of
41,290

,
also
one
of
the

Switzerland
has
one
of
the
best
environmental
records
among
nations
in
the
developed
world
;
it
was
one
of
the
countries
to
sign
the
Kyoto
Protocol
in
1998
and
ratified
it
in
2003
.
With
Mexico
and
the
Republic
of
Korea
it
forms
the
Environmental
Integrity
Group
(
EIG
)
.
The
country
is
heavily
active
in
recycling
and
anti-littering
regulations
and
is
one
of
the
top
recyclers
in
the
world
,
with
66
%
to
96
%
of
recyclable
materials
being
recycled
,
depending
on
the
area
of
the
country

In
many
places
in
Switzerland
,
household
rubbish
disposal
is
charged
for
.
Rubbish
(
except
dangerous
items
,
batteries
etc.
)
is
only
collected
if
it
is
in
bags
which
either
have
a
payment
sticker
attached
,
or
in
official
bags
with
the
surcharge
paid
at
the
time
of
purchase
.
This
gives
a
financial
incentive
to
recycle
as
much
as
possible
,
since
recycling
is
free
.
Illegal
disposal
of
garbage
is
not
tolerated
but
usually
the
enforcement
of
such
laws
is
limited
to
violations
that
involve
the
unlawful
disposal
of
larger
volumes
at
traffic
intersections
and
public
areas
.
Fines
for
not
paying
the
disposal
fee
range
from
CHF
200–500
.
In
2012
,
resident
foreigners
made
up
23.3
%
of
the
population
.
Most
of
these
(
64
%
)
were
from
European
Union
or
EFTA
countries
.
Italians
were
the
largest
single
group
of
foreigners
with
15.6
%
of
total
foreign
population
.
They
were
closely
followed
by
Germans
(
15.2
%
)
,
immigrants
from
Portugal
(
12.7
%
)
,
France
(
5.6
%
)
,
Serbia
(
5.3
%
)
,
Turkey
(
3.8
%
)
,
Spain
(
3.7
%
)
,
and
Austria
(
2
%
)
.
Immigrants
from
Sri
Lanka
,
most
of
them
former
Tamil
refugees
,
were
the
largest
group
among
people
of
Asian
origin
(
6.3
%
)
.
Additionally
,
the
figures
from
2012
show
that
34.7
%
of
the
permanent
resident
population
aged
15
or
over
in
Switzerland
,
i.e.
2,335,000
persons
,
had
an
immigrant
background
.
A
third
of
this
population
(
853,000
)
held
Swiss
citizenship
.
Four
fifths
of
persons
with
an
immigration
background
were
themselves
immigrants
(
first
generation
foreigners
and
native
-
born
and
naturalised
Swiss
citizens
)
,
whereas
one
fifth
were
born
in
Switzerland
(
second
generation
foreigners
and
native
-
born
and
naturalised
Swiss
citizens
)
.
In
the
2000s
,
domestic
and
international
institutions
expressed
concern
about
what
they
perceived
as
an
increase
in
xenophobia
,
particularly
in
some
political
campaigns
.
In
reply
to
one
critical
report
the
Federal
Council
noted
that
"
racism
unfortunately
is
present
in
Switzerland
"
,
but
stated
that
the
high
proportion
of
foreign
citizens
in
the
country
,
as
well
as
the
generally
unproblematic
integration
of
foreigners
"
,
underlined
Switzerland
's
openness
.
Switzerland
has
four
official
languages
:
principally
German
(
63.5
%
total
population
share
,
with
foreign
residents
,
in
2013
)
;
French
(
22.5
%
)
in
the
west
;
and
Italian
(
8.1
%
)
in
the
south
.
The
fourth
official
language
,
Romansh
(
0.5
%
)
,
is
a
Romance
language
spoken
locally
in
the
southeastern
trilingual
canton
of
Graubünden
,
and
is
designated
by
Article
4
of
the
Federal
Constitution
as
a
national
language
along
with
German
,
French
,
and
Italian
,
and
in
Article
70
as
an
official
language
if
the
authorities
communicate
with
persons
who
speak
Romansh
.
However
,
federal
laws
and
other
official
acts
do
not
need
to
be
decreed
in
Romansh
.
Aside
from
the
official
forms
of
their
respective
languages
,
the
four
linguistic
regions
of
Switzerland
also
have
their
local
dialectal
forms
.
The
role
played
by
dialects
in
each
linguistic
region
varies
dramatically
:
in
the
German-speaking
regions
,
Swiss
German
dialects
have
become
ever
more
prevalent
since
the
second
half
of
the
20th
century
,
especially
in
the
media
,
such
as
radio
and
television
,
and
are
used
as
an
everyday
language
,
while
the
Swiss
variety
of
Standard
German
is
almost
always
used
instead
of
dialect
for
written
communication
(
c.f.
diglossic
usage
of
a
language
)
.
Conversely
,
in
the
French-speaking
regions
the
local
dialects
have
almost
disappeared
(
only
6.3
%
of
the
population
of
Valais
,
3.9
%
of
Fribourg
,
and
3.1
%
of
Jura
still
spoke
dialects
at
the
end
of
the
20th
century
)
,
while
in
the
Italian
-
speaking
regions
dialects
are
mostly

The
principal
official
languages
(
German
,
French
,
and
Italian
)
have
terms
,
not
used
outside
of
Switzerland
,
known
as
Helvetisms
.
German
Helvetisms
are
,
roughly
speaking
,
a
large
group
of
words
typical
of
Swiss
Standard
German
,
which
do
not
appear
either
in
Standard
German
,
nor
in
other
German
dialects
.
These
include
terms
from
Switzerland
's
surrounding
language
cultures
(
German
Billette
from
French
)
,
from
similar
term
in
another
language
(
Italian
azione
used
not
only
as
act
but
also
as
discount
from
German
Aktion
)
.
The
French
spoken
in
Switzerland
has
similar
terms
,
which
are
equally
known
as
Helvetisms
.
The
most
frequent
characteristics
of
Helvetisms
are
in
vocabulary
,
phrases
,
and
pronunciation
,
but
certain
Helvetisms
denote
themselves
as
special
in
syntax
and
orthography
likewise
.
Duden
,
one
of
the
prescriptive
sources
for
Standard
German
,
is
aware
of
about
3000
Helvetisms
.
Current
French
dictionaries
,
such
as
the
Petit
Larousse
,
include
several
hundred
Helvetisms
.
Swiss
citizens
are
universally
required
to
buy
health
insurance
from
private
insurance
companies
,
which
in
turn
are
required
to
accept
every
applicant
.
While
the
cost
of
the
system
is
among
the
highest
it
compares
well
with
other
European
countries
in
terms
of
health
outcomes
;
patients
who
are
citizens
have
been
reported
as
being
,
in
general
,
highly
satisfied
with
it
.
In
2012
,
life
expectancy
at
birth
was
80.4
years
for
men
and
84.7
years
for
women
—
the
highest
in
the
world
.
However
,
spending
on
health
is
particularly
high
at
11.4
%
of
GDP
(
2010
)
,
on
par
with
Germany
and
France
(
11.6
%
)
and
other
European
countries
,
and
notably
less
than
spending
in
the
USA
(
17.6
%
)
.
From
1990
,
a
steady
increase
can
be
observed
,
reflecting
the
high
costs
of
the
services
provided
.
With
an
ageing
population
and
new
healthcare
technologies
,
health
spending
will
likely
continue
to
rise
.
Between
two
thirds
and
three
quarters
of
the
population
live
in
urban
areas
.
Switzerland
has
gone
from
a
largely
rural
country
to
an
urban
one
in
just
70
years
.
Since
1935
urban
development
has
claimed
as
much
of
the
Swiss
landscape
as
it
did
during
the
previous
2,000
years
.
This
urban
sprawl
does
not
only
affect
the
plateau
but
also
the
Jura
and
the
Alpine
foothills
and
there
are
growing
concerns
about
land
use
.
However
,
from
the
beginning
of
the
21st
century
,
the
population
growth
in
urban
areas
is
higher
than
in
the
countryside
.
Switzerland
has
a
dense
network
of
cities
,
where
large
,
medium
and
small
cities
are
complementary
.
The
plateau
is
very
densely
populated
with
about
450
people
per
km2
and
the
landscape
continually
shows
signs
of
human
presence
.
The
weight
of
the
largest
metropolitan
areas
,
which
are
Zürich
,
Geneva
–Lausanne
,
Basel
and
Bern
tend
to
increase
.
In
international
comparison
the
importance
of
these
urban
areas
is
stronger
than
their
number
of
inhabitants
suggests
.
In
addition
the
two
main
centers
of
Zürich
and
Geneva
are
recognized
for
their
particularly
great
quality
of
life
.
Christianity
is
the
predominant
religion
of
Switzerland
(
about
71
%
of
resident
population
and
75
%
of
Swiss
citizens
)
,
divided
between
the
Catholic
Church
(
38.21
%
of
the
population
)
,
the
Swiss
Reformed
Church
(
26.93
%
)
,
further
Protestant
churches
(
2.89
%
)
and
other
Christian
denominations
(
2.79
%
)
.
There
has
been
a
recent
rise
in
Evangelicalism
.
Immigration
has
brought
Islam
(
4.95
%
)
and
Eastern
Orthodoxy
(
around
2
%
)
as
sizeable
minority
religions
.
According
to
a
2015
poll
by
Gallup
International
,
12
%
of
Swiss
people
self-identified
as
"
convinced
atheists
.
"
As
of
the
2000
census
other
Christian
minority
communities
include
Neo-Pietism
(
0.44

)
,
Pentecostalism
(

21.4
%
in
2012
declared
themselves
as
unchurched
i.e.
not
affiliated
with
any
church
or
other
religious
body
(
Agnostic
,
Atheist
,
or
just
not
related

)
.
The
country
was
historically
about
evenly
balanced
between
Catholic
and
Protestant
,
with
a
complex
patchwork
of
majorities
over
most
of
the
country
.
Geneva
converted
to
Protestantism
in
1536
,
just
before
John
Calvin
arrived
there
.
One
canton
,
Appenzell
,
was
officially
divided
into
Catholic
and
Protestant
sections
in
1597
.
The
larger
cities
and
their
cantons
(
Bern
,
Geneva
,
Lausanne
,
Zürich
and
Basel
)
used
to
be
predominantly
Protestant
.
Central
Switzerland
,
the
Valais
,
the
Ticino
,
Appenzell
Innerrhodes
,
the
Jura
,
and
Fribourg
are
traditionally
Catholic
.
The
Swiss
Constitution
of
1848
,
under
the
recent
impression
of
the
clashes
of
Catholic
vs
.
Protestant
cantons
that
culminated
in
the
Sonderbundskrieg
,
consciously
defines
a
consociational
state
,
allowing
the
peaceful
co-existence
of
Catholics
and
Protestants
.
A
1980
initiative
calling
for
the
complete
separation
of
church
and
state
was
rejected
by
78.9
%
of
the
voters
.
Some
traditionally
Protestant
cantons
and
cities
nowadays
have
a
slight
Catholic
majority
,
not
because
they
were
growing
in
members
,
quite
the
contrary
,
but
only
because
since
about
1970
a
steadily
growing
minority
became
not
affiliated
with
any
church
or
other
religious
body
(
21.4
%
in
Switzerland
,
2012
)
especially
in
traditionally
Protestant
regions
,
such
as
Basel
-
City
(
42
%
)
,
canton
of
Neuchâtel
(
38

,
canton
of
Geneva

.
Three
of
Europe
's
major
languages
are
official
in
Switzerland
.
Swiss
culture
is
characterised
by
diversity
,
which
is
reflected
in
a
wide
range
of
traditional
customs
.
A
region
may
be
in
some
ways
strongly
culturally
connected
to
the
neighbouring
country
that
shares
its
language
,
the
country
itself
being
rooted
in
western
European
culture
.
The
linguistically
isolated
Romansh
culture
in
Graubünden
in
eastern
Switzerland
constitutes
an
exception
,
it
survives
only
in
the
upper
valleys
of
the
Rhine
and
the
Inn
and
strives
to
maintain
its
rare
linguistic
tradition
.
Alpine
symbolism
has
played
an
essential
role
in
shaping
the
history
of
the
country
and
the
Swiss
national
identity
.
Nowadays
some
concentrated
mountain
areas
have
a
strong
highly
energetic
ski
resort
culture
in
winter
,
and
a
hiking
(
ger
:
das
Wandern
)
or
Mountain
biking
culture
in
summer
.
Other
areas
throughout
the
year
have
a
recreational
culture
that
caters
to
tourism
,
yet
the
quieter
seasons
are
spring
and
autumn
when
there
are
fewer
visitors
.
A
traditional
farmer
and
herder
culture
also
predominates
in
many
areas
and
small
farms
are
omnipresent
outside
the
cities
.
Folk
art
is
kept
alive
in
organisations
all
over
the
country
.
In
Switzerland
it
is
mostly
expressed
in
music
,
dance
,
poetry
,
wood
carving
and
embroidery
.
The
alphorn
,
a
trumpet
-
like
musical
instrument
made
of
wood
,
has
become
alongside
yodeling
and
the
accordion
an
epitome
of
traditional
Swiss
music
.
The
government
exerts
greater
control
over
broadcast
media
than
print
media
,
especially
due
to
finance
and
licensing
.
The
Swiss
Broadcasting
Corporation
,
whose
name
was
recently
changed
to
SRG
SSR
,
is
charged
with
the
production
and
broadcast
of
radio
and
television
programs
.
SRG
SSR
studios
are
distributed
throughout
the
various
language
regions
.
Radio
content
is
produced
in
six
central
and
four
regional
studios
while
the
television
programs
are
produced
in
Geneva
,
Zürich
and
Lugano
.
An
extensive
cable
network
also
allows
most
Swiss
to
access
the
programs
from
neighboring
countries
.
Skiing
,
snowboarding
and
mountaineering
are
among
the
most
popular
sports
in
Switzerland
,
the
nature
of
the
country
being
particularly
suited
for
such
activities
.
Winter
sports
are
practiced
by
the
natives
and
tourists
since
the
second
half
of
the
19th
century
with
the
invention
of
bobsleigh
in
St.
Moritz
.
The
first
world
ski
championships
were
held
in
Mürren
(
1931
)
and
St.
Moritz
(
1934
)
.
The
latter
town
hosted

Traditional
sports
include
Swiss
wrestling
or
"
Schwingen
"
.
It
is
an
old
tradition
from
the
rural
central
cantons
and
considered
the
national
sport
by
some
.
Hornussen
is
another
indigenous
Swiss

.
Steinstossen
is
the
Swiss
variant
of
stone
put
,
a
competition
in
throwing
a
heavy
stone
.
Practiced
only
among
the
alpine
population
since
prehistoric
times
,
it
is
recorded
to
have
taken
place
in
Basel
in
the
13th
century
.
It
is
also
central
to
the
Unspunnenfest
,
first
held
in
1805
,
with
its
symbol
the
83.5
kg
stone
named
Unspunnenstein
.
The
cuisine
of
Switzerland
is
multifaceted
.
While
some
dishes
such
as
fondue
,
raclette
or
rösti
are
omnipresent
through
the
country
,
each
region
developed
its
own
gastronomy
according
to
the
differences
of
climate
and
languages
.
Traditional
Swiss
cuisine
uses
ingredients
similar
to
those
in
other
European
countries
,
as
well
as
unique
dairy
products
and
cheeses
such
as
Gruyère
or
Emmental
,
produced
in
the
valleys
of
Gruyères
and
Emmental
.
The
number
of
fine-dining
establishments
is
high
,
particularly
in
western
Switzerland
.
The
most
popular
alcoholic
drink
in
Switzerland
is
wine
.
Switzerland
is
notable
for
the
variety
of
grapes
grown
because
of
the
large
variations
in
terroirs
,
with
their
specific
mixes
of
soil
,
air
,
altitude
and
light
.
Swiss
wine
is
produced
mainly
in
Valais
,
Vaud
(
Lavaux
)
,
Geneva
and
Ticino
,
with
a
small
majority
of
white
wines
.
Vineyards
have
been
cultivated
in
Switzerland
since
the
Roman
era
,
even
though
certain
traces
can
be
found
of
a
more
ancient
origin
.
The
most
widespread
varieties
are
the
Chasselas
(
called
Fendant
in
Valais
)
and
Pinot
noir
.
The
Merlot
is
the
main
variety
produced
in
Ticino
.
Child
labour
refers
to
the
employment
of
children
in
any
work
that
deprives
children
of
their
childhood
,
interferes
with
their
ability
to
attend
regular
school
,
and
that
is
mentally
,
physically
,
socially
or
morally
dangerous
and
harmful
.
This
practice
is
considered
exploitative
by
many
international
organisations
.
Legislation
across
the
world
prohibit
child
labour
.
These
laws
do
not
consider
all
work
by
children
as
child
labour
;
exceptions
include
work
by
child
artists
,
family
duties
,
supervised
training
,
certain
categories
of
work
such
as
those
by
Amish
children
,
some
forms
of
child
work
common
among
indigenous
American
children
,
and
others
.
In
developing
countries
,
with
high
poverty
and
poor
schooling
opportunities
,
child
labour
is
still
prevalent
.
In
2010
,
sub-saharan
Africa
had
the
highest
incidence
rates
of
child
labour
,
with
several
African
nations
witnessing
over
50
percent
of
children
aged
5
–
14
working
.
Worldwide
agriculture
is
the
largest
employer
of
child
labour
.
Vast
majority
of
child
labour
is
found
in
rural
settings
and
informal
urban
economy
;
children
are
predominantly
employed
by
their
parents
,
rather
than
factories
.
Poverty
and
lack
of
schools
are
considered
as
the
primary
cause
of
child
labour
.
The
work
of
children
was
important
in
pre-industrial
societies
,
as
children
needed
to
provide
their
labour
for
their
survival
and
that
of
their
group
.
Pre-industrial
societies
were
characterised
by
low
productivity
and
short
life
expectancy
,
preventing
children
from
participating
in
productive
work
would
be
more
harmful
to
their
welfare
and
that
of
their
group
in
the
long
run
.
In
pre-industrial
societies
,
there
was
little
need
for
children
to
attend
school
.
This
is
especially
the
case
in
non
literate
societies
.
Most
pre-industrial
skill
and
knowledge
were
amenable
to
being
passed
down
through
direct
mentoring
or
apprenticing
by
competent
adults
.
The
Victorian
era
in
particular
became
notorious
for
the
conditions
under
which
children
were
employed
.
Children
as
young
as
four
were
employed
in
production
factories
and
mines
working
long
hours
in
dangerous
,
often
fatal
,
working
conditions
.
In
coal
mines
,
children
would
crawl
through
tunnels
too
narrow
and
low
for
adults
.
Children
also
worked
as
errand
boys
,
crossing
sweepers
,
shoe
blacks
,
or
selling
matches
,
flowers
and
other
cheap
goods
.
Some
children
undertook
work
as
apprentices
to
respectable
trades
,
such
as
building
or
as
domestic
servants
(
there
were
over
120,000
domestic
servants
in
London
in
the
mid-18th
century
)
.
Working
hours
were
long
:
builders
worked
64
hours
a
week
in
summer
and
52
in
winter
,
while
domestic
servants
worked
80
hour
weeks
.
Child
labour
played
an
important
role
in
the
Industrial
Revolution
from
its
outset
,
often
brought
about
by
economic
hardship
.
The
children
of
the
poor
were
expected
to
contribute
to
their
family
income
.
In
19th
-century
Great
Britain
,
one
-
third
of
poor
families
were
without
a
breadwinner
,
as
a
result
of
death
or
abandonment
,
obliging
many
children
to
work
from
a
young
age
.
In
England
and
Scotland
in
1788
,
two
-thirds
of
the
workers
in
143
water
-
powered
cotton
mills
were
described
as
children
.
A
high
number
of
children
also
worked
as
prostitutes
.
The
author
Charles
Dickens
worked
at
the
age
of
12
in
a
blacking
factory
,
with
his
family
in
debtor
's
prison
.
Throughout
the
second
half
of
the
19th
century
,
child
labour
began
to
decline
in
industrialised
societies
due
to
regulation
and
economic
factors
.
The
regulation
of
child
labour
began
from
the
earliest
days
of
the
Industrial
revolution
.
The
first
act
to
regulate
child
labour
in
Britain
was
passed
in
1803
.
As
early
as
1802
and
1819
Factory
Acts
were
passed
to
regulate
the
working
hours
of
workhouse
children
in
factories
and
cotton
mills
to
12
hours
per
day
.
These
acts
were
largely
ineffective
and
after
radical
agitation
,
by
for
example
the
"
Short
Time
Committees
"
in
1831
,
a
Royal
Commission
recommended
in
1833
that
children
aged
11
–
18
should
work
a
maximum
of
12
hours
per
day
,
children
aged
9–11
a
maximum
of
eight
hours
,
and
children
under
the
age
of
nine
were
no
longer
permitted
to
work
.
This
act
however
only
applied
to
the
textile
industry
,
and
further
agitation
led
to
another
act
in
1847
limiting
both
adults
and
children
to
10
-
hour
working
days
.
Lord
Shaftesbury
was
an
outspoken
advocate
of
regulating
child
labour
.
In
the
early
20th
century
,
thousands
of
boys
were
employed
in
glass
making
industries
.
Glass
making
was
a
dangerous
and
tough
job
especially
without
the
current
technologies
.
The
process
of
making
glass
includes
intense
heat
to
melt
glass
(
3133
°
F
)
.
When
the
boys
are
at
work
,
they
are
exposed
to
this
heat
.
This
could
cause
eye
trouble
,
lung
ailments
,
heat
exhaustion
,
cut
,
and
burns
.
Since
workers
were
paid
by
the
piece
,
they
had
to
work
productively
for
hours
without
a
break
.
Since
furnaces
had
to
be
constantly
burning
,
there
were
night
shifts
from
5:00
pm
to
3:00
am
.
Many
factory
owners
preferred
boys
under
16
years
of
age
.
In
1910
,
over
2
million
children
in
the
same
age
group
were
employed
in
the
United
States
.
This
included
children
who
rolled
cigarettes
,
engaged
in
factory
work
,
worked
as
bobbin
doffers
in
textile
mills
,
worked
in
coal
mines
and
were
employed
in
canneries
.
Lewis
Hine
's
photographs
of
child
labourers
in
the
1910s
powerfully
evoked
the
plight
of
working
children
in
the
American
south
.
Hines
took
these
photographs
between
1908
and
1917
as
the
staff
photographer
for
the
National
Child
Labor
Committee
.
Factories
and
mines
were
not
the
only
places
where
child
labour
was
prevalent
in
the
early
20th
century
.
Home
-
based
manufacturing
across
the
United
States
and
Europe
employed
children
as
well
.
Governments
and
reformers
argued
that
labour
in
factories
must
be
regulated
and
the
state
had
an
obligation
to
provide
welfare
for
poor
.
Legislation
that
followed
had
the
effect
of
moving
work
out
of
factories
into
urban
homes
.
Families
and
women
,
in
particular
,
preferred
it
because
it
allowed
them
to
generate
income
while
taking
care
of
household
duties
.
Home
-
based
manufacturing
operations
were
active
year
round
.
Families
willingly
deployed
their
children
in
these
income
generating
home
enterprises
.
In
many
cases
,
men
worked
from
home
.
In
France
,
over
58
percent
of
garment
workers
operated
out
of
their
homes
;
in
Germany
,
the
number
of
full-time
home
operations
nearly
doubled
between
1882
and
1907
;
and
in
the
United
States
,
millions
of
families
operated
out
of
home
seven
days
a
week
,
year
round
to
produce
garments
,
shoes
,
artificial
flowers
,
feathers
,
match
boxes
,
toys
,
umbrellas
and
other
products
.
Children
aged
5
–
14
worked
alongside
the
parents
.
Home
-
based
operations
and
child
labour
in
Australia
,
Britain
,
Austria
and
other
parts
of
the
world
was
common
.
Rural
areas
similarly
saw
families
deploying
their
children
in
agriculture
.
In
1946
,
Frieda
Miller
-
then
Director
of
United
States
Department
of
Labour
-
told
the
International
Labour
Organisation
that
these
home
-
based
operations
offered
,
"
low
wages
,
long
hours
,
child
labour
,
unhealthy
and
insanitary
working
conditions
.
"
Child
labour
is
still
common
in
many
parts
of
the
world
.
Estimates
for
child
labour
vary
.
It
ranges
between
250
and
304
million
,
if
children
aged
5
–
17
involved
in
any
economic
activity
are
counted
.
If
light
occasional
work
is
excluded
,
ILO
estimates
there
were
153
million
child
labourers
aged
5
–
14
worldwide
in
2008
.
This
is
about
20
million
less
than
ILO
estimate
for
child
labourers
in
2004
.
Some
60
percent
of
the
child
labour
was
involved
in
agricultural
activities
such
as
farming
,
dairy
,
fisheries
and
forestry
.
Another
25
percent
of
child
labourers
were
in
service
activities
such
as
retail
,
hawking
goods
,
restaurants
,
load
and
transfer
of
goods
,
storage
,
picking
and
recycling
trash
,
polishing
shoes
,
domestic
help
,
and
other
services
.
The
remaining
15
percent
laboured
in
assembly
and
manufacturing
in
informal
economy
,
home
-
based
enterprises
,
factories
,
mines
,
packaging
salt
,
operating
machinery
,
and
such
operations
.
Two
out
of
three
child
workers
work
alongside
their
parents
,
in
unpaid
family
work
situations
.
Some
children
work
as
guides
for
tourists
,
sometimes
combined
with
bringing
in
business
for
shops
and
restaurants
.
Child
labour
predominantly
occurs
in
the
rural
areas
(
70
%
)
and
informal
urban
sector
(
26
%
)
.
Child
labour
accounts
for
22
%
of
the
workforce
in
Asia
,
32
%
in
Africa
,
17
%
in
Latin
America
,
1
%
in
the
US
,
Canada
,
Europe
and
other
wealthy
nations
.
The
proportion
of
child
labourers
varies
greatly
among
countries
and
even
regions
inside
those
countries
.
Africa
has
the
highest
percentage
of
children
aged
5
–
17
employed
as
child
labour
,
and
a
total
of
over
65
million
.
Asia
,
with
its
larger
population
,
has
the
largest
number
of
children
employed
as
child
labour
at
about
114
million
.
Latin
America
and
Caribbean
region
have
lower
overall
population
density
,
but
at
14
million
child
labourers
has
high
incidence
rates
too
.
Accurate
present
day
child
labour
information
is
difficult
to
obtain
because
of
disagreements
between
data
sources
as
to
what
constitutes
child
labour
.
In
some
countries
,
government
policy
contributes
to
this
difficulty
.
For
example
,
the
overall
extent
of
child
labour
in
China
is
unclear
due
to
the
government
categorizing
child
labour
data
as
“
highly
secret
”
.
China
has
enacted
regulations
to
prevent
child
labour
;
still
,
the
practice
of
child
labour
is
reported
to
be
a
persistent
problem
within
China
,
generally
in
agriculture
and
low-skill
service
sectors
as
well
as
small
workshops
and
manufacturing
enterprises
.
In
2014
,
the
U.S.
Department
of
Labor
issued
a
List
of
Goods
Produced
by
Child
Labor
or
Forced
Labor
where
China
was
attributed
12
goods
the
majority
of
which
were
produced
by
both
underage
children
and
indentured
labourers
.
The
report
listed
electronics
,
garments
,
toys
and
coal
among
other
goods
.
Maplecroft
Child
Labour
Index
2012
survey
reports
76
countries
pose
extreme
child
labour
complicity
risks
for
companies
operating
worldwide
.
The
ten
highest
risk
countries
in
2012
,
ranked
in
decreasing
order
,
were
:
Myanmar
,
North
Korea
,
Somalia
,
Sudan
,
DR

,
Zimbabwe
,
Afghanistan
,
Burundi
,
Pakistan
and
Ethiopia
.
Of
the
major
growth
economies
,
Maplecroft
ranked
Philippines
25th
riskiest
,
India
27th
,
China
36th
,
Viet
Nam
37th
,
Indonesia
46th
,
and
Brazil
54th
-
all
of
them
rated
to
involve
extreme
risks
of
child
labour
uncertainties
,
to
corporations
seeking
to
invest
in
developing
world
and
import
products
from
emerging
markets
.
Lack
of
meaningful
alternatives
,
such
as
affordable
schools
and
quality
education
,
according
to
ILO
,
is
another
major
factor
driving
children
to
harmful
labour
.
Children
work
because
they
have
nothing
better
to
do
.
Many
communities
,
particularly
rural
areas
where
between
60–70
%
of
child
labour
is
prevalent
,
do
not
possess
adequate
school
facilities
.
Even
when
schools
are
sometimes
available
,
they
are
too
far
away
,
difficult
to
reach
,
unaffordable
or
the
quality
of
education
is
so
poor
that
parents
wonder
if
going
to
school
is
really
worth
it
.
In
European
history
when
child
labour
was
common
,
as
well
as
in
contemporary
child
labour
of
modern
world
,
certain
cultural
beliefs
have
rationalised
child
labour
and
thereby
encouraged
it
.
Some
view
that
work
is
good
for
the
character
-
building
and
skill
development
of
children
.
In
many
cultures
,
particular
where
the
informal
economy
and
small
household
businesses
thrive
,
the
cultural
tradition
is
that
children
follow
in
their
parents
'
footsteps
;
child
labour
then
is
a
means
to
learn
and
practice
that
trade
from
a
very
early
age
.
Similarly
,
in
many
cultures
the
education
of
girls
is
less
valued
or
girls
are
simply
not
expected
to
need
formal
schooling
,
and
these
girls
pushed
into
child
labour
such
as
providing
domestic
services
.
Biggeri
and
Mehrotra
have
studied
the
macroeconomic
factors
that
encourage
child
labour
.
They
focus
their
study
on
five
Asian
nations
including
India
,
Pakistan
,
Indonesia
,
Thailand
and
Philippines
.
They
suggest
that
child
labour
is
a
serious
problem
in
all
five
,
but
it
is
not
a
new
problem
.
Macroeconomic
causes
encouraged
widespread
child
labour
across
the
world
,
over
most
of
human
history
.
They
suggest
that
the
causes
for
child
labour
include
both
the
demand
and
the
supply
side
.
While
poverty
and
unavailability
of
good
schools
explain
the
child
labour
supply
side
,
they
suggest
that
the
growth
of
low-paying
informal
economy
rather
than
higher
paying
formal
economy
is
amongst
the
causes
of
the
demand
side
.
Other
scholars
too
suggest
that
inflexible
labour
market
,
sise
of
informal
economy
,
inability
of
industries
to
scale
up
and
lack
of
modern
manufacturing
technologies
are
major
macroeconomic
factors
affecting
demand
and
acceptability
of
child
labour
.
Systematic
use
of
child
labour
was
common
place
in
the
colonies
of
European
powers
between
1650
and
1950
.
In
Africa
,
colonial
administrators
encouraged
traditional
kin-ordered
modes
of
production
,
that
is
hiring
a
household
for
work
not
just
the
adults
.
Millions
of
children
worked
in
colonial
agricultural
plantations
,
mines
and
domestic
service
industries
.
Sophisticated
schemes
were
promulgated
where
children
in
these
colonies
between
the
ages
of
5
–
14
were
hired
as
an
apprentice
without
pay
in
exchange
for
learning
a
craft
.
A
system
of
Pauper
Apprenticeship
came
into
practice
in
the
19th
century
where
the
colonial
master
neither
needed
the
native
parents
'
nor
child
's
approval
to
assign
a
child
to
labour
,
away
from
parents
,
at
a
distant
farm
owned
by
a
different
colonial
master
.
Other
schemes
included
'
earn
-
and-
learn
'
programs
where
children
would
work
and
thereby
learn
.
Britain
for
example
passed
a
law
,
the
so-called
Masters
and
Servants
Act
of
1899
,
followed
by
Tax
and
Pass
Law
,
to
encourage
child
labour
in
colonies
particularly
in
Africa
.
These
laws
offered
the
native
people
the
legal
ownership
to
some
of
the
native
land
in
exchange
for
making
labour
of
wife
and
children
available
to
colonial
government
's
needs
such
as
in
farms
and
as
picannins
.
In
southeast
Asian
colonies
,
such
as
Hong
Kong
,
child
labour
such
as
the
Mui
Tsai
(
妹仔
)
,
was
rationalised
as
a
cultural
tradition
and
ignored
by
British
authorities
.
The
Dutch
East
India
Company
officials
rationalised
their
child
labour
abuses
with
,
"
it
is
a
way
to
save
these
children
from
a
worse
fate
.
"
Christian
mission
schools
in
regions
stretching
from
Zambia
to
Nigeria
too
required
work
from
children
,
and
in
exchange
provided
religious
education
,
not
secular
education
.
Elsewhere
,
the
Canadian
Dominion
Statutes
in
form
of
so-called
Breaches
of
Contract
Act
,
stipulated
jail
terms
for
uncooperative
child
workers
.
Children
working
at
a
young
age
has
been
a
consistent
theme
throughout
Africa
.
Many
children
began
first
working
in
the
home
to
help
their
parents
run
the
family
farm
.
Children
in
Africa
today
are
often
forced
into
exploitative
labour
due
to
family
debt
and
other
financial
factors
,
leading
to
ongoing
poverty
.
Other
types
of
domestic
child
labour
include
working
in
commercial
plantations
,
begging
,
and
other
sales
such
as
boot
shining
.
In
total
,
there
is
an
estimated
five
million
children
who
are
currently
working
in
the
field
of
agriculture
which
steadily
increases
during
the
time
of
harvest
.
Along
with
30
percent
of
children
who
are
picking
coffee
,
there
are
an
estimated
25,000
school
age
children
who
work
year
round
.
What
industries
children
work
in
depends
on
if
they
grew
up
in
a
rural
area
or
an
urban
area
.
Children
who
were
born
in
urban
areas
often
found
themselves
working
for
street
vendors
,
washing
cars
,
helping
in
construction
sites
,
weaving
clothing
,
and
sometimes
even
working
as
exotic
dancers
.
While
children
who
grew
up
in
rural
areas
would
work
on
farms
doing
physical
labour
,
working
with
animals
,
and
selling
crops
.
Of
all
the
child
workers
,
the
most
serious
cases
involved
street
children
and
trafficked
children
due
to
the
physical
and
emotional
abuse
they
endured
by
their
employers
.
To
address
the
issue
of
child
labour
,
the
United
Nations
Conventions
on
the
Rights
of
the
Child
Act
was
implemented
in
1959
.
Yet
due
to
poverty
,
lack
of
education
and
ignorance
,
the
legal
actions
were
not
/
are
not
wholly
enforced
or
accepted
in
Africa
.
Other
legal
factors
that
have
been
implemented
to
end
and
reduce
child
labour
includes
the
global
response
that
came
into
force
in
1979
by
the
declaration
of
the
International
Year
of
the
Child
.
Along
with
the
Human
Rights
Committee
of
the
United
Nations
,
these
two
declarations
worked
on
many
levels
to
eliminate
child
labour
.
Although
many
actions
have
been
taken
to
end
this
epidemic
,
child
labour
in
Africa
is
still
an
issue
today
due
to
the
unclear
definition
of
adolescence
and
how
much
time
is
needed
for
children
to
engage
in
activities
that
are
crucial
for
their
development
.
Another
issue
that
often
comes
into
play
is
the
link
between
what
constitutes
as
child
labour
within
the
household
due
to
the
cultural
acceptance
of
children
helping
run
the
family
business
.
In
the
end
,
there
is
a
consistent
challenge
for
the
national
government
to
strengthen
its
grip
politically
on
child
labour
,
and
to
increase
education
and
awareness
on
the
issue
of
children
working
below
the
legal
age
limit
.
With
children
playing
an
important
role
in
the
African
economy
,
child
labour
still
plays
an
important
role
for
many
in
the
20th
century
.
From
European
settlement
in
1888
,
child
convicts
were
occasionally
sent
to
Australia
where
they
were
made
to
work
.
Child
labour
was
not
as
excessive
in
Australia
as
in
Britain
.
With
a
low
population
,
agricultural
productivity
was
higher
and
families
did
not
face
starvation
as
in
established
industrialised
countries
.
Australia
also
did
not
have
significant
industry
until
the
later
part
of
the
20th
century
when
child
labour
laws
,
and
compulsory
schooling
had
developed
under
the
influence
of
Britain
.
From
the
1870s
Child
labour
was
restricted
by
compulsorry
schooling
.
Child
labour
has
been
a
consistent
struggle
for
children
in
Brazil
ever
since
the
country
was
colonized
on
April
22
,
1550
by
Pedro
Álvares
Cabral
.
Work
that
many
children
took
part
in
was
not
always
visible
,
legal
,
or
paid
.
Free
or
slave
labour
was
a
common
occurrence
for
many
youths
and
was
a
part
of
their
everyday
lives
as
they
grew
into
adulthood
.
Yet
due
to
there
being
no
clear
definition
of
how
to
classify
what
a
child
or
youth
is
,
there
has
been
little
historical
documentation
of
child
labour
during
the
colonial
period
.
Due
to
this
lack
of
documentation
,
it
is
hard
to
determine
just
how
many
children
were
used
for
what
kinds
of
work
before
the
nineteenth
century
.
The
first
documentation
of
child
labour
in
Brazil
occurred
during
the
time
of
indigenous
societies
and
slave
labour
where
it
was
found
that
children
were
forcibly
working
on
tasks
that
exceeded
their
emotional
and
physical
limits
.
Armando
Dias
,
for
example
,
died
in
November
1913
whilst
still
very
young
,
a
victim
of
an
electric
shock
when
entering
the
textile
industry
where
he
worked
.
Boys
and
girls
were
victims
of
industrial
accidents
on
a
daily
basis
.
In
Brazil
,
the
minimum
working
age
has
been
identified
as
fourteen
due
to
continuous
constitutional
amendments
that
occurred
in
1934
,
1937
,
and
1946
.
Yet
due
to
a
change
in
the
dictatorship
by
the
military
in
the
80
’s
,
the
minimum
age
restriction
was
reduced
to
the
age
of
twelve
but
was
reviewed
due
to
reports
of
dangerous
and
hazardous
working
conditions
in
1988
.
This
led
to
the
minimum
age
being
raised
once
again
to
14
.
Another
set
of
restrictions
was
passed
in
1998
that
restricted
the
kinds
of
work
youth
could
partake
in
,
such
as
work
that
was
considered
hazardous
like
running
construction
equipment
,
or
certain
kinds
of
factory
work
.
Although
many
steps
were
taken
to
reduce
the
risk
and
occurrence
of
child
labour
,
there
is
still
a
high
number
of
children
and
adolescents
working
under
the
age
of
fourteen
in
Brazil
.
It
was
not
until
recently
in
the
80
’s
that
it
was
discovered
that
almost
nine
million
children
in
Brazil
were
working
illegally
and
not
partaking
in
traditional
childhood
activities
that
help
to
develop
important
life
experiences
.
Brazilian
census
data
(
PNAD
,
1999
)
indicate
that
2.55
million
10
-
14
year-olds
were
illegally
holding
jobs
.
They
were
joined
by
3.7
million
15
-
17
year-olds
and
about
375,000
5
-
9
year-olds
.
Due
to
the
raised
age
restriction
of
14
,
at
least
half
of
the
recorded
young
workers
had
been
employed
illegally
which
lead
to
many
not
being
protect
by
important
labour
laws
.
Although
substantial
time
has
passed
since
the
time
of
regulated
child
labour
,
there
is
still
a
large
number
of
children
working
illegally
in
Brazil
.
Many
children
are
used
by
drug
cartels
to
sell
and
carry
drugs
,
guns
,
and
other
illegal
substances
because
of
their
perception
of
innocence
.
This
type
of
work
that
youth
are
taking
part
in
is
very
dangerous
due
to
the
physical
and
psychological
implications
that
come
with
these
jobs
.
Yet
despite
the
hazards
that
come
with
working
with
drug
dealers
,
there
has
been
an
increase
in
this
area
of
employment
throughout
the
country
.
Many
factors
played
a
role
in
Britain
’s
long-
term
economic
growth
,
such
as
the
industrial
revolution
in
the
late
1700s
and
the
prominent
presence
of
child
labour
during
the
industrial
age
.
Children
who
worked
at
an
early
age
were
often
not
forced
;
but
did
so
because
they
needed
to
help
their
family
survive
financially
.
Due
to
poor
employment
opportunities
for
many
parents
,
sending
their
children
to
work
on
farms
and
in
factories
was
a
way
to
help
feed
and
support
the
family
.
Child
Labour
first
started
to
occur
in
England
when
household
businesses
were
turned
into
local
labour
markets
that
mass
-produced
the
once
homemade
goods
.
Because
children
often
helped
produce
the
goods
out
of
their
homes
,
working
in
a
factory
to
make
those
same
goods
was
a
simple
change
for
many
of
these
youths
.
Although
there
are
many
counts
of
children
under
the
age
of
ten
working
for
factories
,
the
majority
of
children
workers
were
between
the
ages
of
ten
and
fourteen
.
This
age
range
was
an
important
time
for
many
youths
as
they
were
first
helping
to
provide
for
their
families
;
while
also
transitioning
to
save
for
their
own
future
families
.
Besides
the
obligation
,
many
children
had
to
help
support
their
families
financially
;
another
factor
that
influenced
child
labour
was
the
demographic
changes
that
occurred
in
the
eighteenth
century
.
By
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
,
20
percent
of
the
population
was
made
up
of
children
between
the
ages
of
5
and
14
.
Due
to
this
substantial
shift
in
available
workers
,
and
the
development
of
the
industrial
revolution
,
children
began
to
work
earlier
in
life
in
companies
outside
of
the
home
.
Yet
,
even
though
there
was
an
increase
of
child
labour
in
factories
such
as
cotton
textiles
,
there
consistently
was
large
numbers
of
children
working
in
the
field
of
agriculture
and
domestic
production
.
With
such
a
high
percentage
of
children
working
,
the
rising
of
illiteracy
,
and
the
lack
of
a
formal
education
became
a
widespread
issue
for
many
children
who
worked
to
provide
for
their
families
.
Due
to
this
problematic
trend
,
many
parents
developed
a
change
of
opinion
when
deciding
whether
or
not
to
send
their
children
to
work
.
Other
factors
that
lead
to
the
decline
of
child
labour
included
financial
changes
in
the
economy
,
changes
in
the
development
of
technology
,
raised
wages
,
and
continuous
regulations
on
factory
legislation
.
The
first
legal
steps
taken
to
end
the
occurrence
of
child
labour
was
enacted
more
than
fifty
years
ago
.
In
1966
,
the
nation
adopted
the
UN
General
Assembly
of
the
International
Covenant
on
Economic
,
Social
and
Cultural
Rights
.
This
act
legally
limited
the
minimum
age
for
when
children
could
start
work
at
the
age
of
14
.
But
23
years
later
in
1989
the
Convention
on
the
Rights
of
Children
was
adopted
and
helped
to
reduce
the
exploitation
of
children
and
demanded
safe
working
environments
.
They
all
worked
towards
the
goal
of
ending
the
most
problematic
forms
of
child
labour
.
On
23
June
1757
,
the
English
East
India
Company
defeated
Siraj-
ud-
Daula
,
the
Nawab
of
Bengal
,
in
the
Battle
of
Plassey
.
The
British
thus
became
masters
of
east
India
(
Bengal
,
Bihar
,
Orissa
)
–
a
prosperous
region
with
a
flourishing
agriculture
,
industry
and
trade
.
This
led
to
a
large
amount
of
children
being
forced
into
labour
due
to
the
increasing
need
of
cheap
labour
to
produce
large
numbers
of
goods
.
Many
multinationals
often
employed
children
because
that
they
can
be
recruited
for
less
pay
,
and
have
more
endurance
to
utilise
in
factory
environments
.
Another
reason
many
Indian
children
were
hired
was
because
they
lack
knowledge
of
their
basic
rights
,
they
did
not
cause
trouble
or
complain
,
and
they
were
often
more
trustworthy
.
The
innocence
that
comes
with
childhood
was
utilised
to
make
a
profit
by
many
and
was
encouraged
by
the
need
for
family
income
.
A
variety
of
Indian
social
scientists
as
well
as
the
Non-Governmental
Organization
(
NGOs
)
have
done
extensive
research
on
the
numeric
figures
of
child
labour
found
in
India
and
determined
that
India
contributes
to
one
-
third
of
Asia
’s
child
labour
and
one-fourth
of
the
world
's
child
labour
.
Due
to
a
large
number
of
children
being
illegally
employed
,
the
Indian
government
began
to
take
extensive
actions
to
reduce
the
number
of
children
working
,
and
to
focus
on
the
importance
of
facilitating
the
proper
growth
and
development
of
children
.
International
influences
help
to
encourage
legal
actions
to
be
taken
in
India
,
such
as
the
Geneva
Declaration
of
the
Right
of
Children
Act
was
passed
in
1924
.
This
act
was
followed
by
The
Universal
Declaration
of
Human
Rights
in
1948
to
which
incorporated
the
basic
human
rights
and
needs
of
children
for
proper
progression
and
growth
in
their
younger
years
.
These
international
acts
encouraged
major
changes
to
the
workforce
in
India
which
occurred
in
1986
when
the
Child
Labour
(
Prohibition
and
Regulation
)
Act
was
put
into
place
.
This
act
prohibited
hiring
children
younger
than
the
age
of
14
,
and
from
working
in
hazardous
conditions
.
From
the
1950s
on
,
the
students
were
also
used
for
unpaid
work
at
schools
,
where
they
cleaned
and
performed
repairs
.
This
practice
has
continued
in
the
Russian
Federation
,
where
up
to
21
days
of
the
summer
holidays
is
sometimes
set
aside
for
school
works
.
By
law
,
this
is
only
allowed
as
part
of
specialized
occupational
training
and
with
the
students
'
and
parents
'
permission
,
but
those
provisions
are
widely
ignored
.
In
2012
there
was
an
accident
near
city
of
Nalchik
where
a
car
killed
several
pupils
cleaning
up
a
highway
shoulder
during
their
"
holiday
work
"
as
well
as
their
teacher
who
was
supervising
them
.
Out
of
former
Soviet
Union
republics
Uzbekistan
continued
and
expanded
the
program
of
child
labour
on
industrial
scale
to
increase
profits
on
the
main
source
of
Islam
Karimov
's
income
,
cotton
harvesting
.
In
September
,
when
school
normally
starts
,
the
classes
are
suspended
and
children
are
sent
to
cotton
fields
for
work
,
where
they
are
assigned
daily
quotas
of
20
to
60
kg
of
raw
cotton
they
have
to
collect
.
This
process
is
repeated
in
spring
,
when
collected
cotton
needs
to
be
hoed
and
weeded
.
In
2006
it
is
estimated
that
2.7
million
children
were
forced
to
work
this
way
.
As
in
many
other
countries
,
child
labour
in
Switzerland
affected
among
the
so-called
Kaminfegerkinder
(
"
chimney
sweep
children
"
)
and
chidren
working
p.e.
in
spinning
mills
,
factories
and
in
agriculture
in
19th
-
century
Switzerland
,
but
also
to
the
1960s
so-called
Verdingkinder
(
literally
:
"
contract
children
"
or
"
indentured
child
laborers
"
)
were
children
who
were
taken
from
their
parents
,
often
due
to
poverty
or
moral
reasons
–
usually
mothers
being
unmarried
,
very
poor
citizens
,
of
Gypsy
–Yeniche
origin
,
so-called
Kinder
der
Landstrasse
,
etc.
–
and
sent
to
live
with
new
families
,
often
poor
farmers
who
needed
cheap
labour
.
There
were
even
Verdingkinder
auctions
where
children
were
handed
over
to
the
farmer
asking
the
least
amount
of
money
from
the
authorities
,
thus
securing
cheap
labour
for
his
farm
and
relieving
the
authority
from
the
financial
burden
of
looking
after
the
children
.
In
the
1930s
20
%
of
all
agricultural
labourers
in
the
Canton
of
Bern
were
children
below
the
age
of
15
.
Swiss
municipality
guardianship
authorities
acted
so
,
commonly
tolerated
by
federal
authorities
,
to
the
1960s
,
not
all
of
them
of
course
,
but
usually
communities
affected
of
low
taxes
in
some
Swiss
cantons
Swiss
historian
Marco
Leuenberger
investigated
,
that
in
1930
there
were
some
35,000
indentured
children
,
and
between
1920
and
1970
more
than
100,000
are
believed
to
have
been
placed
with
families
or
homes
.
10,000
Verdingkinder
are
still
alive
.
Therefore
,
the
so-called
Wiedergutmachungsinitiative
was
started
in
April
2014
.
In
April
2014
the
collection
of
targeted
at
least
authenticated
100,000
signatures
of
Swiss
citizens
has
started
,
and
still
have
to
be
collected
to
October
2015
.
In
1999
,
ILO
helped
lead
the
Worst
Forms
Convention
182
(
C182
)
,
which
has
so
far
been
signed
upon
and
domestically
ratified
by
151
countries
including
the
United
States
.
This
international
law
prohibits
worst
forms
of
child
labour
,
defined
as
all
forms
of
slavery
and
slavery
-
like
practices
,
such
as
child
trafficking
,
debt
bondage
,
and
forced
labour
,
including
forced
recruitment
of
children
into
armed
conflict
.
The
law
also
prohibits
the
use
of
a
child
for
prostitution
or
the
production
of
pornography
,
child
labour
in
illicit
activities
such
as
drug
production
and
trafficking
;
and
in
hazardous
work
.
Both
the
Worst
Forms
Convention
(
C182
)
and
the
Minimum
Age
Convention
(
C138
)
are
examples
of
international
labour
standards
implemented
through
the
ILO
that
deal
with
child
labour
.
In
addition
to
setting
the
international
law
,
the
United
Nations
initiated
International
Program
on
the
Elimination
of
Child
Labour
(
IPEC
)
in
1992
.
This
initiative
aims
to
progressively
eliminate
child
labour
through
strengthening
national
capacities
to
address
some
of
the
causes
of
child
labour
.
Amongst
the
key
initiative
is
the
so-called
time
-
bounded
programme
countries
,
where
child
labour
is
most
prevalent
and
schooling
opportunities
lacking
.
The
initiative
seeks
to
achieve
amongst
other
things
,
universal
primary
school
availability
.
The
IPEC
has
expanded
to
at
least
the
following
target
countries
:
Bangladesh
,
Brazil
,
China
,
Egypt
,
India
,
Indonesia
,
Mexico
,
Nigeria
,
Pakistan
,
Democratic
Republic
of
Congo
,
El
Salvador
,
Nepal
,
Tanzania
,
Dominican
Republic
,
Costa
Rica
,
Philippines
,
Senegal
,
South
Africa
and
Turkey
.
In
2004
,
the
United
States
passed
an
amendment
to
the
Fair
Labour
Standards
Act
of
1938
.
The
amendment
allows
certain
children
aged
14–
18
to
work
in
or
outside
a
business
where
machinery
is
used
to
process
wood
.
The
law
aims
to
respect
the
religious
and
cultural
needs
of
the
Amish
community
of
the
United
States
.
The
Amish
believe
that
one
effective
way
to
educate
children
is
on
the
job
.
The
new
law
allows
Amish
children
the
ability
to
work
with
their
families
,
once
they
are
passed
eighth
grade
in
school
.
Similarly
,
in
1996
,
member
countries
of
the
European
Union
,
per
Directive
94/33
/
EC
,
agreed
to
a
number
of
exceptions
for
young
people
in
its
child
labour
laws
.
Under
these
rules
,
children
of
various
ages
may
work
in
cultural
,
artistic
,
sporting
or
advertising
activities
if
authorised
by
the
competent
authority
.
Children
above
the
age
of
13
may
perform
light
work
for
a
limited
number
of
hours
per
week
in
other
economic
activities
as
defined
at
the
discretion
of
each
country
.
Additionally
,
the
European
law
exception
allows
children
aged
14
years
or
over
to
work
as
part
of
a
work
/
training
scheme
.
The
EU
Directive
clarified
that
these
exceptions
do
not
allow
child
labour
where
the
children
may
experience
harmful
exposure
to
dangerous
substances
.
Nonetheless
,
many
children
under
the
age
of
13
do
work
,
even
in
the
most
developed
countries
of
the
EU
.
For
instance
,
a
recent
study
showed
over
a
third
of
Dutch
twelve
-
year
-
old
kids
had
a
job
,
the
most
common
being
babysitting
.
Some
scholars
[
who
?
]
suggest
any
labour
by
children
aged
18
years
or
less
is
wrong
since
this
encourages
illiteracy
,
inhumane
work
and
lower
investment
in
human
capital
.
Child
labour
,
claim
these
activists
,
also
leads
to
poor
labour
standards
for
adults
,
depresses
the
wages
of
adults
in
developing
countries
as
well
as
the
developed
countries
,
and
dooms
the
third
world
economies
to
low-skill
jobs
only
capable
of
producing
poor
quality
cheap
exports
.
More
children
that
work
in
poor
countries
,
the
fewer
and
worse
-
paid
are
the
jobs
for
adults
in
these
countries
.
In
other
words
,
there
are
moral
and
economic
reasons
that
justify
a
blanket
ban
on
labour
from
children
aged
18
years
or
less
,
everywhere
in
the
world
.
Other
scholars
[
who
?
]
suggest
that
these
arguments
are
flawed
,
ignores
history
and
more
laws
will
do
more
harm
than
good
.
According
to
them
,
child
labour
is
merely
the
symptom
of
a
greater
disease
named
poverty
.
If
laws
ban
all
lawful
work
that
enables
the
poor
to
survive
,
informal
economy
,
illicit
operations
and
underground
businesses
will
thrive
.
These
will
increase
abuse
of
the
children
.
In
poor
countries
with
very
high
incidence
rates
of
child
labour
-
such
as
Ethiopia
,
Chad
,
Niger
and
Nepal
-
schools
are
not
available
,
and
the
few
schools
that
exist
offer
poor
quality
education
or
are
unaffordable
.
The
alternatives
for
children
who
currently
work
,
claim
these
studies
,
are
worse
:
grinding
subsistence
farming
,
militia
or
prostitution
.
Child
labour
is
not
a
choice
,
it
is
a
necessity
,
the
only
option
for
survival
.
It
is
currently
the
least
undesirable
of
a
set
of
very
bad
choices
.
These
scholars
suggest
,
from
their
studies
of
economic
and
social
data
,
that
early
20th
-
century
child
labour
in
Europe
and
the
United
States
ended
in
large
part
as
a
result
of
the
economic
development
of
the
formal
regulated
economy
,
technology
development
and
general
prosperity
.
Child
labour
laws
and
ILO
conventions
came
later
.
Edmonds
suggests
,
even
in
contemporary
times
,
the
incidence
of
child
labour
in
Vietnam
has
rapidly
reduced
following
economic
reforms
and
GDP
growth
.
These
scholars
suggest
economic
engagement
,
emphasis
on
opening
quality
schools
rather
than
more
laws
and
expanding
economically
relevant
skill
development
opportunities
in
the
third
world
.
International
legal
actions
,
such
as
trade
sanctions
increase
child
labour
.
In
1998
,
UNICEF
reported
that
Ivory
Coast
farmers
used
enslaved
children
–
many
from
surrounding
countries
.
In
late
2000
a
BBC
documentary
reported
the
use
of
enslaved
children
in
the
production
of
cocoa
—
the
main
ingredient
in
chocolate
—
in
West
Africa
.
Other
media
followed
by
reporting
widespread
child
slavery
and
child
trafficking
in
the
production
of
cocoa
.
In
2001
,
the
US
State
Department
estimated
there
were
15,000
child
slaves
cocoa
,
cotton
and
coffee
farms
in
the
Ivory
Coast
,
and
the
Chocolate
Manufacturers
Association
acknowledged
that
child
slavery
is
used
in
the
cocoa
harvest
.

Malian
migrants
have
long
worked
on
cocoa
farms
in
the
Ivory
Coast
,
but
in
2000
cocoa
prices
had
dropped
to
a
10
-
year
low
and
some
farmers
stopped
paying
their
employees
.
The
Malian
counsel
had
to
rescue
some
boys
who
had
not
been
paid
for
five
years
and
who
were
beaten
if
they
tried
to
run
away
.
Malian
officials
believed
that
15,000
children
,
some
as
young
as
11
years
old
,
were
working
in
the
Ivory
Coast
in
2001
.
These
children
were
often
from
poor
families
or
the
slums
and
were
sold
to
work
in
other
countries
.
Parents
were
told
the
children
would
find
work
and
send
money
home
,
but
once
the
children
left
home
,
they
often
worked
in
conditions
resembling
slavery
.
In
other
cases
,
children
begging
for
food
were
lured
from
bus
stations
and
sold
as
slaves
.
In
2002
,
the
Ivory
Coast
had
12,000
children
with
no
relatives
nearby
,
which
suggested
they
were
trafficked
,
likely
from
neighboring
Mali
,
Burkina
Faso
and
Togo
.
The
cocoa
industry
was
accused
of
profiting
from
child
slavery
and
trafficking
.
The
European
Cocoa
Association
dismissed
these
accusations
as
"
false
and
excessive
"
and
the
industry
said
the
reports
were
not
representative
of
all
areas
.
Later
the
industry
acknowledged
the
working
conditions
for
children
were
unsatisfactory
and
children
's
rights
were
sometimes
violated
and
acknowledged
the
claims
could
not
be
ignored
.
In
a
BBC
interview
,
the
ambassador
for
Ivory
Coast
to
the
United
Kingdom
called
these
reports
of
widespread
use
of
slave
child
labour
by
700,000
cocoa
farmers
as
absurd
and
inaccurate
.
In
2001
,
a
voluntary
agreement
called
the
Harkin-Engel
Protocol
,
was
accepted
by
the
international
cocoa
and
chocolate
industry
to
eliminate
the
worst
forms
of
child
labour
,
as
defined
by
ILO
's
Convention
182
,
in
West
Africa
.
This
agreement
created
a
foundation
named
International
Cocoa
Initiative
in
2002
.
The
foundation
claims
it
has
,
as
of
2011
,
active
programs
in
290
cocoa
growing
communities
in
Côte
d'Ivoire
and
Ghana
,
reaching
a
total
population
of
689,000
people
to
help
eliminate
the
worst
forms
of
child
labour
in
cocoa
industry
.
Other
organisations
claim
progress
has
been
made
,
but
the
protocol
's
2005
deadlines
have
not
yet
been
met
.
In
2008
,
Bloomberg
claimed
child
labour
in
copper
and
cobalt
mines
that
supplied
Chinese
companies
in
Congo
.
The
children
are
creuseurs
,
that
is
they
dig
the
ore
by
hand
,
carry
sacks
of
ores
on
their
backs
,
and
these
are
then
purchased
by
these
companies
.
Over
60
of
Katanga
's
75
processing
plants
are
owned
by
Chinese
companies
and
90
percent
of
the
region
's
minerals
go
to
China
.
An
African
NGO
report
claimed
80,000
child
labourers
under
the
age
of
15
,
or
about
40
%
of
all
miners
,
were
supplying
ore
to
Chinese
companies
in
this
African
region
.
Amnesty
International
alleged
in
2016
that
some
cobalt
sold
by
Congo
Dongfang
Mining
was
produced
by
child
labor
,
and
that
it
was
being
used
in
lithium
-ion
batteries
powering
electric
cars
and
mobile
devices
worldwide
.
BBC
,
in
2012
,
accused
Glencore
of
using
child
labour
in
its
mining
and
smelting
operations
of
Africa
.
Glencore
denied
it
used
child
labour
,
and
said
it
has
strict
policy
of
not
using
child
labour
.
The
company
claimed
it
has
a
strict
policy
whereby
all
copper
was
mined
correctly
,
placed
in
bags
with
numbered
seals
and
then
sent
to
the
smelter
.
Glencore
mentioned
being
aware
of
child
miners
who
were
part
of
a
group
of
artisanal
miners
who
had
without
authorisation
raided
the
concession
awarded
to
the
company
since
2010
;
Glencore
has
been
pleading
with
the
government
to
remove
the
artisanal
miners
from
the
concession
.
Small-scale
artisanal
mining
of
gold
is
another
source
of
dangerous
child
labour
in
poor
rural
areas
in
certain
parts
of
the
world
.
This
form
of
mining
uses
labour-intensive
and
low-tech
methods
.
It
is
informal
sector
of
the
economy
.
Human
Rights
Watch
group
estimates
that
about
12
percent
of
global
gold
production
comes
from
artisanal
mines
.
In
west
Africa
,
in
countries
such
as
Mali
-
the
third
largest
exporter
of
gold
in
Africa
-
between
20,000
and
40,000
children
work
in
artisanal
mining
.
Locally
known
as
orpaillage
,
children
as
young
as
6
years
old
work
with
their
families
.
These
children
and
families
suffer
chronic
exposure
to
toxic
chemicals
including
mercury
,
and
do
hazardous
work
such
as
digging
shafts
and
working
underground
,
pulling
up
,
carrying
and
crushing
the
ore
.
The
poor
work
practices
harm
the
long
term
health
of
children
,
as
well
as
release
hundreds
of
tons
of
mercury
every
year
into
local
rivers
,
ground
water
and
lakes
.
Gold
is
important
to
the
economy
of
Mali
and
Ghana
.
For
Mali
,
it
is
the
second
largest
earner
of
its
export
revenue
.
For
many
poor
families
with
children
,
it
is
the
primary
and
sometimes
the
only
source
of
income
.
In
early
August
2008
,
Iowa
Labour
Commissioner
David
Neil
announced
that
his
department
had
found
that
Agriprocessors
,
a
kosher
meatpacking
company
in
Postville
which
had
recently
been
raided
by
Immigration
and
Customs
Enforcement
,
had
employed
57
minors
,
some
as
young
as
14
,
in
violation
of
state
law
prohibiting
anyone
under
18
from
working
in
a
meatpacking
plant
.
Neil
announced
that
he
was
turning
the
case
over
to
the
state
Attorney
General
for
prosecution
,
claiming
that
his
department
's
inquiry
had
discovered
"
egregious
violations
of
virtually
every
aspect
of
Iowa
's
child
labour
laws
.
"
Agriprocessors
claimed
that
it
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
the
allegations
.
Agriprocessors
'
CEO
went
to
trial
on
these
charges
in
state
court
on
4
May
2010
.
After
a
five-week
trial
he
was
found
not
guilty
of
all
57
charges
of
child
labour
violations
by
the
Black
Hawk
County
District
Court
jury
in
Waterloo
,
Iowa
,
on
7
June
2010
.
In
December
2009
,
campaigners
in
the
UK
called
on
two
leading
high
street
retailers
to
stop
selling
clothes
made
with
cotton
which
may
have
been
picked
by
children
.
Anti-Slavery
International
and
the
Environmental
Justice
Foundation
(
EJF
)
accused
H&M
and
Zara
of
using
cotton
suppliers
in
Bangladesh
.
It
is
also
suspected
that
many
of
their
raw
materials
originates
from
Uzbekistan
,
where
children
aged
10
are
forced
to
work
in
the
fields
.
The
activists
were
calling
to
ban
the
use
of
Uzbek
cotton
and
implement
a
"
track
and
trace
"
systems
to
guarantee
an
ethical
responsible
source
of
the
material
.
In
2008
,
the
BBC
reported
that
the
company
Primark
was
using
child
labor
in
the
manufacture
of
clothing
.
In
particular
,
a
£
4
hand
-
embroidered
shirt
was
the
starting
point
of
a
documentary
produced
by
BBC
's
Panorama
programme
.
The
programme
asks
consumers
to
ask
themselves
,
"
Why
am
I
only
paying
£
4
for
a
hand
embroidered
top
?
This
item
looks
handmade
.
Who
made
it
for
such
little
cost
?
"
,
in
addition
to
exposing
the
violent
side
of
the
child
labour
industry
in
countries
where
child
exploitation
is
prevalent
.
Primark
continued
to
investigate
the
allegations
for
three
years
,
concluding
that
BBC
report
was
a
fake
.
In
2011
,
following
an
investigation
by
the
BBC
Trust
’s
Editorial
Standards
Committee
,
the
BBC
announced
,
"
Having
carefully
scrutinised
all
of
the
relevant
evidence
,
the
committee
concluded
that
,
on
the
balance
of
probabilities
,
it
was
more
likely
than
not
that
the
Bangalore
footage
was
not
authentic
.
"
BBC
subsequently
apologised
for
faking
footage
,
and
returned
the
television
award
for
investigative
reporting
.
Concerns
have
often
been
raised
over
the
buying
public
's
moral
complicity
in
purchasing
products
assembled
or
otherwise
manufactured
in
developing
countries
with
child
labour
.
However
,
others
have
raised
concerns
that
boycotting
products
manufactured
through
child
labour
may
force
these
children
to
turn
to
more
dangerous
or
strenuous
professions
,
such
as
prostitution
or
agriculture
.
For
example
,
a
UNICEF
study
found
that
after
the
Child
Labour
Deterrence
Act
was
introduced
in
the
US
,
an
estimated
50,000
children
were
dismissed
from
their
garment
industry
jobs
in
Bangladesh
,
leaving
many
to
resort
to
jobs
such
as
"
stone
-
crushing
,
street
hustling
,
and
prostitution
"
,
jobs
that
are
"
more
hazardous
and
exploitative
than
garment
production
"
.
The
study
suggests
that
boycotts
are
"
blunt
instruments
with
long
-
term
consequences
,
that
can
actually
harm
rather
than
help
the
children
involved
.
"
According
to
Milton
Friedman
,
before
the
Industrial
Revolution
virtually
all
children
worked
in
agriculture
.
During
the
Industrial
Revolution
many
of
these
children
moved
from
farm
work
to
factory
work
.
Over
time
,
as
real
wages
rose
,
parents
became
able
to
afford
to
send
their
children
to
school
instead
of
work
and
as
a
result
child
labour
declined
,
both
before
and
after
legislation
.
Austrian
School
economist
Murray
Rothbard
said
that
British
and
American
children
of
the
pre-
and
post-Industrial
Revolution
lived
and
suffered
in
infinitely
worse
conditions
where
jobs
were
not
available
for
them
and
went
"
voluntarily
and
gladly
"
to
work
in
factories
.
According
to
Thomas
DeGregori
,
an
economics
professor
at
the
University
of
Houston
,
in
an
article
published
by
the
Cato
Institute
,
a
libertarian
think
-
tank
operating
in
Washington
D.C.
,
"
it
is
clear
that
technological
and
economic
change
are
vital
ingredients
in
getting
children
out
of
the
workplace
and
into
schools
.
Then
they
can
grow
to
become
productive
adults
and
live
longer
,
healthier
lives
.
However
,
in
poor
countries
like
Bangladesh
,
working
children
are
essential
for
survival
in
many
families
,
as
they
were
in
our
own
heritage
until
the
late
19th
century
.
So
,
while
the
struggle
to
end
child
labour
is
necessary
,
getting
there
often
requires
taking
different
routes
—
and
,
sadly
,
there
are
many
political
obstacles
.
The
term
child
labour
can
be
misleading
when
it
confuses
harmful
work
with
employment
that
may
be
beneficial
to
children
.
It
can
also
ignore
harmful
work
outside
employment
and
any
benefits
children
normally
derive
from
their
work
.
Domestic
work
is
an
example
:
all
families
but
the
rich
must
work
at
cleaning
,
cooking
,
caring
,
and
more
to
maintain
their
homes
.
In
most
families
in
the
world
,
this
process
extends
to
productive
activities
,
especially
herding
and
various
types
of
agriculture
,
and
to
a
variety
of
small
family
businesses
.
Where
trading
is
a
significant
feature
of
social
life
,
children
can
start
trading
in
small
items
at
an
early
age
,
often
in
the
company
of
family
members
or
of
peers
.
Work
is
undertaken
from
an
early
age
by
vast
numbers
of
children
in
the
world
and
may
have
a
natural
place
in
growing
up
.
Work
can
contribute
to
the
well
-
being
of
children
in
a
variety
of
ways
;
children
often
choose
to
work
to
improve
their
lives
,
both
in
the
short
-
and
long-term
.
At
the
material
level
,
children
’s
work
often
contributes
to
producing
food
or
earning
income
that
benefits
themselves
and
their
families
;
and
such
income
is
especially
important
when
the
families
are
poor
.
Work
can
provide
an
escape
from
debilitating
poverty
,
sometimes
by
allowing
a
young
person
to
move
away
from
an
impoverished
environment
.
Young
people
often
enjoy
their
work
,
especially
paid
work
,
or
when
work
involves
the
company
of
peers
.
Even
when
work
is
intensive
and
enforced
,
children
often
find
ways
to
combine
their
work
with
play
.
While
full-
time
work
hinders
schooling
,
empirical
evidence
is
varied
on
the
relationship
between
part-time
work
and
school
.
Sometimes
even
part-time
work
may
hinder
school
attendance
or
performance
.
On
the
other
hand
,
many
poor
children
work
for
resources
to
attend
school
.
Children
who
are
not
doing
well
at
school
sometimes
seek
more
satisfactory
experience
in
work
.
Good
relations
with
a
supervisor
at
work
can
provide
relief
from
tensions
that
children
feel
at
school
and
home
.
In
the
modern
world
,
school
education
has
become
so
central
to
society
that
schoolwork
has
become
the
dominant
work
for
most
children
,
often
replacing
participation
in
productive
work
.
If
school
curricula
or
quality
do
not
provide
children
with
appropriate
skills
for
available
jobs
or
if
children
do
nor
have
the
aptitude
for
schoolwork
,
school
may
impede
the
learning
of
skills
,
such
as
agriculture
,
which
will
become
necessary
for
future
livelihood
.
Textual
criticism
is
a
branch
of
textual
scholarship
,
philology
,
and
literary
criticism
that
is
concerned
with
the
identification
of
textual
variants
in
either
manuscripts
or
printed
books
.
Ancient
scribes
made
alterations
when
copying
manuscripts
by
hand
.
Given
a
manuscript
copy
,
several
or
many
copies
,
but
not
the
original
document
,
the
textual
critic
might
seek
to
reconstruct
the
original
text
(
the
archetype
or
autograph
)
as
closely
as
possible
.
The
same
processes
can
be
used
to
attempt
to
reconstruct
intermediate
versions
,
or
recensions
,
of
a
document
's
transcription
history
.
The
ultimate
objective
of
the
textual
critic
's
work
is
the
production
of
a
"
critical
edition
"
containing
a
scholarly
curated
text
.
Many
ancient
works
,
such
as
the
Bible
and
the
Greek
tragedies
,
[
citation
needed
]
survive
in
hundreds
of
copies
,
and
the
relationship
of
each
copy
to
the
original
may
be
unclear
.
Textual
scholars
have
debated
for
centuries
which
sources
are
most
closely
derived
from
the
original
,
hence
which
readings
in
those
sources
are
correct
.
[

Although
biblical
books
that
are
letters
,
like
Greek
plays
,
presumably
had
one
original
,
the
question
of
whether
some
biblical
books
,
like
the
Gospels
,
ever
had
just
one
original
has
been
discussed
.
Interest
in
applying
textual
criticism
to
the
Qur'an
has
also
developed
after
the
discovery
of
the
Sana'a
manuscripts
in
1972
,
which
possibly
date
back
to
the
7–8th
centuries
.
In
the
English
language
,
the
works
of
Shakespeare
have
been
a
particularly
fertile
ground
for
textual
criticism
—
both
because
the
texts
,
as
transmitted
,
contain
a
considerable
amount
of
variation
,
and
because
the
effort
and
expense
of
producing
superior
editions
of
his
works
have
always
been
widely
viewed
as
worthwhile
.
The
principles
of
textual
criticism
,
although
originally
developed
and
refined
for
works
of
antiquity
,
the
Bible
,
and
Shakespeare
,
have
been
applied
to
many
works
,
extending
backwards
from
the
present
to
the
earliest
known
written
documents
,
in
Mesopotamia
and
Egypt
—
a
period
of
about
five
millennia
.
However
,
the
application
of
textual
criticism
to
non-religious
works
does
not
antedate
the
invention
of
printing
.
While
Christianity
has
been
relatively
receptive
to
textual
criticism
,
application
of
it
to
the
Jewish
(
Masoretic
)
Torah
and
the
Qur'an
is
,
to
the
devout
,
taboo
.

comments
further
that
"
A
dictation
revised
by
the
author
must
be
regarded
as
equivalent
to
an
autograph
manuscript
"
.
The
lack
of
autograph
manuscripts
applies
to
many
cultures
other
than
Greek
and
Roman
.
In
such
a
situation
,
a
key
objective
becomes
the
identification
of
the
first
exemplar
before
any
split
in
the
tradition
.
That
exemplar
is
known
as
the
archetype
.
"
If
we
succeed
in
establishing
the
text
of
[
the
archetype
]
,
the
constitutio
(
reconstruction
of
the
original
)
is
considerably
advanced
.
The
textual
critic
's
ultimate
objective
is
the
production
of
a
"
critical

This
contains
the

the
author
has
determined
most
closely
approximates
the
original
,
and
is
accompanied
by
an
apparatus
criticus
or
critical
apparatus
.
The
critical
apparatus
presents
the
author
's
work
in
three
parts
:
first
,
a
list
or
description
of
the
evidence
that
the
editor
used
(
names
of
manuscripts
,
or
abbreviations
called
sigla
)
;
second
,
the
editor
's
analysis
of
that
evidence
(
sometimes
a
simple
likelihood
rating
)
,
[
citation

;
and
third
,
a
record
of
rejected
variants
of
the
text
(
often
in
order
of
preference
)
.
[

Before
mechanical
printing
,
literature
was
copied
by
hand
,
and
many
variations
were
introduced
by
copyists
.
The
age
of
printing
made
the
scribal
profession
effectively
redundant
.
Printed
editions
,
while
less
susceptible
to
the
proliferation
of
variations
likely
to
arise
during
manual
transmission
,
are
nonetheless
not
immune
to
introducing
variations
from
an
author
's
autograph
.
Instead
of
a
scribe
miscopying
his
source
,
a
compositor
or
a
printing
shop
may
read
or
typeset
a
work
in
a
way
that
differs
from
the
autograph
.
Since
each
scribe
or
printer
commits
different
errors
,
reconstruction
of
the
lost
original
is
often
aided
by
a
selection
of
readings
taken
from
many
sources
.
An
edited
text
that
draws
from
multiple
sources
is
said
to
be
eclectic
.
In
contrast
to
this
approach
,
some
textual
critics
prefer
to
identify
the
single
best
surviving
text
,
and
not
to
combine
readings
from
multiple
sources
.
When
comparing
different
documents
,
or
"
witnesses
"
,
of
a
single
,
original
text
,
the
observed
differences
are
called
variant
readings
,
or
simply
variants
or
readings
.
It
is
not
always
apparent
which
single
variant
represents
the
author
's
original
work
.
The
process
of
textual
criticism
seeks
to
explain
how
each
variant
may
have
entered
the
text
,
either
by
accident
(
duplication
or
omission
)
or
intention
(
harmonization
or
censorship
)
,
as
scribes
or
supervisors
transmitted
the
original
author
's
text
by
copying
it
.
The
textual
critic
's
task
,
therefore
,
is
to
sort
through
the
variants
,
eliminating
those
most
likely
to
be
un-original
,
hence
establishing
a
"
critical
text
"
,
or
critical
edition
,
that
is
intended
to
best
approximate
the
original
.
At
the
same
time
,
the
critical
text
should
document
variant
readings
,
so
the
relation
of
extant
witnesses
to
the
reconstructed
original
is
apparent
to
a
reader
of
the
critical
edition
.
In
establishing
the
critical
text
,
the
textual
critic
considers
both
"
external
"
evidence
(
the
age
,
provenance
,
and
affiliation
of
each
witness
)
and
"
internal
"
or
"
physical
"
considerations
(
what
the
author
and
scribes
,
or
printers
,
were
likely
to
have
done
)
.
The
collation
of
all
known
variants
of
a
text
is
referred
to
as
a
variorum
,
namely
a
work
of
textual
criticism
whereby
all
variations
and
emendations
are
set
side
by
side
so
that
a
reader
can
track
how
textual
decisions
have
been
made
in
the
preparation
of
a
text
for
publication
.
The
Bible
and
the
works
of
William
Shakespeare
have
often
been
the
subjects
of
variorum
editions
,
although
the
same
techniques
have
been
applied
with
less
frequency
to
many
other
works
,
such
as
Walt
Whitman
's
Leaves
of
Grass
,
and
the
prose
writings
of
Edward
Fitzgerald
.
Eclectic
readings
also
normally
give
an
impression
of
the
number
of
witnesses
to
each
available
reading
.
Although
a
reading
supported
by
the
majority
of
witnesses
is
frequently
preferred
,
this
does
not
follow
automatically
.
For
example
,
a
second
edition
of
a
Shakespeare
play
may
include
an
addition
alluding
to
an
event
known
to
have
happened
between
the
two
editions
.
Although
nearly
all
subsequent
manuscripts
may
have
included
the
addition
,
textual
critics
may
reconstruct
the
original
without
the
addition
.
External
evidence
is
evidence
of
each
physical
witness
,
its
date
,
source
,
and
relationship
to
other
known
witnesses
.
Critics
will
often
prefer
the
readings
supported
by
the
oldest
witnesses
.
Since
errors
tend
to
accumulate
,
older
manuscripts
should
have
fewer
errors
.
Readings
supported
by
a
majority
of
witnesses
are
also
usually
preferred
,
since
these
are
less
likely
to
reflect
accidents
or
individual
biases
.
For
the
same
reasons
,
the
most
geographically
diverse
witnesses
are
preferred
.
Some
manuscripts
show
evidence
that
particular
care
was
taken
in
their
composition
,
for
example
,
by
including
alternative
readings
in
their
margins
,
demonstrating
that
more
than
one
prior
copy
(
exemplar
)
was
consulted
in
producing
the
current
one
.
Other
factors
being
equal
,
these
are
the
best
witnesses
.
The
role
of
the
textual
critic
is
necessary
when
these
basic
criteria
are
in
conflict
.
For
instance
,
there
will
typically
be
fewer
early
copies
,
and
a
larger
number
of
later
copies
.
The
textual
critic
will
attempt
to
balance
these
criteria
,
to
determine
the
original
text
.
Two
common
considerations
have
the
Latin
names
lectio
brevior
(
shorter
reading
)
and
lectio
difficilior
(
more
difficult
reading
)
.
The
first
is
the
general
observation
that
scribes
tended
to
add
words
,
for
clarification
or
out
of
habit
,
more
often
than
they
removed
them
.
The
second
,
lectio
difficilior
potior
(
the
harder
reading
is
stronger
)
,
recognizes
the
tendency
for
harmonization
—
resolving
apparent
inconsistencies
in
the
text
.
Applying
this
principle
leads
to
taking
the
more
difficult
(
unharmonized
)
reading
as
being
more
likely
to
be
the
original
.
Such
cases
also
include
scribes
simplifying
and
smoothing
texts
they
did
not
fully
understand
.
Brooke
Foss
Westcott
(
1825
–
1901
)
and
Fenton
J.
A.
Hort
(
1828
–
1892
)
published
an
edition
of
the
New
Testament
in
Greek
in
1881
.
They
proposed
nine
critical
rules
,
including
a
version
of
Bengel
's
rule
,
"
The
reading
is
less
likely
to
be
original
that
shows
a
disposition
to
smooth
away
difficulties
.
"
They
also
argued
that
"
Readings
are
approved
or
rejected
by
reason
of
the
quality
,
and
not
the
number
,
of
their
supporting
witnesses
"
,
and
that
"
The
reading
is
to
be
preferred
that
most
fitly
explains
the
existence
of
the
others
.
"
Since
the
canons
of
criticism
are
highly
susceptible
to
interpretation
,
and
at
times
even
contradict
each
other
,
they
may
be
employed
to
justify
a
result
that
fits
the
textual
critic
's
aesthetic
or
theological
agenda
.
Starting
in
the
19th
century
,
scholars
sought
more
rigorous
methods
to
guide
editorial
judgment
.
Best

text
editing
(
a
complete
rejection
of
eclecticism
)
became
one
extreme
.
Stemmatics
and
copy
-
text
editing
–
while
both
eclectic
,
in
that
they
permit
the
editor
to
select
readings
from
multiple
sources
–
sought
to
reduce
subjectivity
by
establishing
one
or
a
few
witnesses
presumably
as
being
favored
by
"
objective
"
criteria
.

The
citing
of
sources
used
,
and
alternate
readings
,
and
the
use
of
original
text
and
images
helps
readers
and
other
critics
determine
to
an
extent
the
depth
of
research
of
the
critic
,
and
to
independently
verify
their
work
.
Stemmatics
,
stemmology
or
stemmatology
is
a
rigorous
approach
to
textual
criticism
.
Karl
Lachmann
(
1793
–
1851
)
greatly
contributed
to
making
this
method
famous
,
even
though
he
did
not
invent
it
.
The
method
takes
its
name
from
the
word
stemma
.
The
Ancient
Greek
word
στέμματα
and
its
loanword
in
classical
Latin
stemmata
may
refer
to
"
family
trees
"
.
This
specific
meaning
shows
the
relationships
of
the
surviving
witnesses
(
the
first
known
example
of
such
a
stemma
,
albeit
with
the
name
,
dates
from
1827
)
.
The
family
tree
is
also
referred
to
as
a
cladogram
.
The
method
works
from
the
principle
that
"
community
of
error
implies
community
of
origin
.
"
That
is
,
if
two
witnesses
have
a
number
of
errors
in
common
,
it
may
be
presumed
that
they
were
derived
from
a
common
intermediate
source
,
called
a
hyparchetype
.
Relations
between
the
lost
intermediates
are
determined
by
the
same
process
,
placing
all
extant
manuscripts
in
a
family
tree
or
stemma
codicum
descended
from
a
single
archetype
.
The
process
of
constructing
the
stemma
is
called
recension
,
or
the
Latin
recensio
.
The
process
of
selectio
resembles
eclectic
textual
criticism
,
but
applied
to
a
restricted
set
of
hypothetical
hyparchetypes
.
The
steps
of
examinatio
and
emendatio
resemble
copy
-
text
editing
.
In
fact
,
the
other
techniques
can
be
seen
as
special
cases
of
stemmatics
in
which
a
rigorous
family
history
of
the
text
cannot
be
determined
but
only
approximated
.
If
it
seems
that
one
manuscript
is
by
far
the
best
text
,
then
copy
text
editing
is
appropriate
,
and
if
it
seems
that
a
group
of
manuscripts
are
good
,
then
eclecticism
on
that
group
would
be
proper
.
The
critic
Joseph
Bédier
(
1864
–
1938
)
launched
a
particularly
withering
attack
on
stemmatics
in
1928
.
He
surveyed
editions
of
medieval
French
texts
that
were
produced
with
the
stemmatic
method
,
and
found
that
textual
critics
tended
overwhelmingly
to
produce
trees
divided
into
just
two
branches
.
He
concluded
that
this
outcome
was
unlikely
to
have
occurred
by
chance
,
and
that
therefore
,
the
method
was
tending
to
produce
bipartite
stemmas
regardless
of
the
actual
history
of
the
witnesses
.
He
suspected
that
editors
tended
to
favor
trees
with
two
branches
,
as
this
would
maximize
the
opportunities
for
editorial
judgment
(
as
there
would
be
no
third
branch
to
"
break
the
tie
"
whenever
the
witnesses
disagreed
)
.
He
also
noted
that
,
for
many
works
,
more
than
one
reasonable
stemma
could
be
postulated
,
suggesting
that
the
method
was
not
as
rigorous
or
as
scientific
as
its
proponents
had
claimed
.
The
stemmatic
method
's
final
step
is
emendatio
,
also
sometimes
referred
to
as
"
conjectural
emendation
.
"
But
in
fact
,
the
critic
employs
conjecture
at
every
step
of
the
process
.
Some
of
the
method
's
rules
that
are
designed
to
reduce
the
exercise
of
editorial
judgment
do
not
necessarily
produce
the
correct
result
.
For
example
,
where
there
are
more
than
two
witnesses
at
the
same
level
of
the
tree
,
normally
the
critic
will
select
the
dominant
reading
.
However
,
it
may
be
no
more
than
fortuitous
that
more
witnesses
have
survived
that
present
a
particular
reading
.
A
plausible
reading
that
occurs
less
often
may
,
nevertheless
,
be
the
correct
one
.
The
bibliographer
Ronald
B.
McKerrow
introduced
the
term
copy
-
text
in
his
1904
edition
of
the
works
of
Thomas
Nashe
,
defining
it
as
"
the
text
used
in
each
particular
case
as
the
basis
of
mine
.
"
McKerrow
was
aware
of
the
limitations
of
the
stemmatic
method
,
and
believed
it
was
more
prudent
to
choose
one
particular
text
that
was
thought
to
be
particularly
reliable
,
and
then
to
emend
it
only
where
the
text
was
obviously
corrupt
.
The
French
critic
Joseph
Bédier
likewise
became
disenchanted
with
the
stemmatic
method
,
and
concluded
that
the
editor
should
choose
the
best
available
text
,
and
emend
it
as
little
as
possible
.
By
1939
,
in
his
Prolegomena
for
the
Oxford
Shakespeare
,
McKerrow
had
changed
his
mind
about
this
approach
,
as
he
feared
that
a
later
edition
–
even
if
it
contained
authorial
corrections
–
would
"
deviate
more
widely
than
the
earliest
print
from
the
author
's
original
manuscript
.
"
He
therefore
concluded
that
the
correct
procedure
would
be
"
produced
by
using
the
earliest
"
good
"
print
as
copy
-
text
and
inserting
into
it
,
from
the
first
edition
which
contains
them
,
such
corrections
as
appear
to
us
to
be
derived
from
the
author
.
"
But
,
fearing
the
arbitrary
exercise
of
editorial
judgment
,
McKerrow
stated
that
,
having
concluded
that
a
later
edition
had
substantive
revisions
attributable
to
the
author
,
"
we
must
accept
all
the
alterations
of
that
edition
,
saving
any
which
seem
obvious
blunders
or
misprints
.
"
Although
Greg
argued
that
an
editor
should
be
free
to
use
his
judgment
to
choose
between
competing
substantive
readings
,
he
suggested
that
an
editor
should
defer
to
the
copy
-
text
when
"
the
claims
of
two
readings
...
appear
to
be
exactly
balanced
.
...
In
such
a
case
,
while
there
can
be
no
logical
reason
for
giving
preference
to
the
copy
-
text
,
in
practice
,
if
there
is
no
reason
for
altering
its
reading
,
the
obvious
thing
seems
to
be
to
let
it
stand
.
"
The
"
exactly
balanced
"
variants
are
said
to
be
indifferent
.
Whereas
Greg
had
limited
his
illustrative
examples
to
English
Renaissance
drama
,
where
his
expertise
lay
,
Bowers
argued
that
the
rationale
was
"
the
most
workable
editorial
principle
yet
contrived
to
produce
a
critical
text
that
is
authoritative
in
the
maximum
of
its
details
whether
the
author
be
Shakespeare
,
Dryden
,
Fielding
,
Nathaniel
Hawthorne
,
or
Stephen
Crane
.
The
principle
is
sound
without
regard
for
the
literary
period
.
"
For
works
where
an
author
's
manuscript
survived
–
a
case
Greg
had
not
considered
–
Bowers
concluded
that
the
manuscript
should
generally
serve
as
copy
-text
.
Citing
the
example
of
Nathaniel
Hawthorne
,
he
noted
:
McKerrow
had
articulated
textual
criticism
's
goal
in
terms
of
"
our
ideal
of
an
author
's
fair
copy
of
his
work
in
its
final
state
"
.
Bowers
asserted
that
editions
founded
on
Greg
's
method
would
"
represent
the
nearest
approximation
in
every
respect
of
the
author
's
final
intentions
.
"
Bowers
stated
similarly
that
the
editor
's
task
is
to
"
approximate
as
nearly
as
possible
an
inferential
authorial
fair
copy
.
"
Tanselle
notes
that
,
"
Textual
criticism
...
has
generally
been
undertaken
with
a
view
to
reconstructing
,
as
accurately
as
possible
,
the
text
finally
intended
by
the
author
"
.
Bowers
and
Tanselle
argue
for
rejecting
textual
variants
that
an
author
inserted
at
the
suggestion
of
others
.
Bowers
said
that
his
edition
of
Stephen
Crane
's
first
novel
,
Maggie
,
presented
"
the
author
's
final
and
uninfluenced
artistic
intentions
.
"
In
his
writings
,
Tanselle
refers
to
"
unconstrained
authorial
intention
"
or
"
an
author
's
uninfluenced
intentions
.
"
This
marks
a
departure
from
Greg
,
who
had
merely
suggested
that
the
editor
inquire
whether
a
later
reading
"
is
one
that
the
author
can
reasonably
be
supposed
to
have
substituted
for
the
former
"
,
not
implying
any
further
inquiry
as
to
why
the
author
had
made
the
change
.
Bowers
confronted
a
similar
problem
in
his
edition
of
Maggie
.
Crane
originally
printed
the
novel
privately
in
1893
.
To
secure
commercial
publication
in
1896
,
Crane
agreed
to
remove
profanity
,
but
he
also
made
stylistic
revisions
.
Bowers
's
approach
was
to
preserve
the
stylistic
and
literary
changes
of
1896
,
but
to
revert
to
the
1893
readings
where
he
believed
that
Crane
was
fulfilling
the
publisher
's
intention
rather
than
his
own
.
There
were
,
however
,
intermediate
cases
that
could
reasonably
have
been
attributed
to
either
intention
,
and
some
of
Bowers
's
choices
came
under
fire
–
both
as
to
his
judgment
,
and
as
to
the
wisdom
of
conflating
readings
from
the
two
different
versions
of
Maggie
.
Some
critics
believe
that
a
clear-text
edition
gives
the
edited
text
too
great
a
prominence
,
relegating
textual
variants
to
appendices
that
are
difficult
to
use
,
and
suggesting
a
greater
sense
of
certainty
about
the
established
text
than
it
deserves
.
As
Shillingsburg
notes
,
"
English
scholarly
editions
have
tended
to
use
notes
at
the
foot
of
the
text
page
,
indicating
,
tacitly
,
a
greater
modesty
about
the
"
established
"
text
and
drawing
attention
more
forcibly
to
at
least
some
of
the
alternative
forms
of
the
text
"
.
Cladistics
is
a
technique
borrowed
from
biology
,
where
it
was
originally
named
phylogenetic
systematics
by
Willi
Hennig
.
In
biology
,
the
technique
is
used
to
determine
the
evolutionary
relationships
between
different
species
.
In
its
application
in
textual
criticism
,
the
text
of
a
number
of
different
manuscripts
is
entered
into
a
computer
,
which
records
all
the
differences
between
them
.
The
manuscripts
are
then
grouped
according
to
their
shared
characteristics
.
The
difference
between
cladistics
and
more
traditional
forms
of
statistical
analysis
is
that
,
rather
than
simply
arranging
the
manuscripts
into
rough
groupings
according
to
their
overall
similarity
,
cladistics
assumes
that
they
are
part
of
a
branching
family
tree
and
uses
that
assumption
to
derive
relationships
between
them
.
This
makes
it
more
like
an
automated
approach
to
stemmatics
.
However
,
where
there
is
a
difference
,
the
computer
does
not
attempt
to
decide
which
reading
is
closer
to
the
original
text
,
and
so
does
not
indicate
which
branch
of
the
tree
is
the
"
root
"
—
which
manuscript
tradition
is
closest
to
the
original
.
Other
types
of
evidence
must
be
used
for
that
purpose
.
Although
some
earlier
unpublished
studies
had
been
prepared
,
not
until
the
early
1970s
was
true
textual
criticism
applied
to
the
Book
of
Mormon
.
At
that
time
BYU
Professor
Ellis
Rasmussen
and
his
associates
were
asked
by
the
LDS
Church
to
begin
preparation
for
a
new
edition
of
the
Holy
Scriptures
.
One
aspect
of
that
effort
entailed
digitizing
the
text
and
preparing
appropriate
footnotes
,
another
aspect
required
establishing
the
most
dependable
text
.
To
that
latter
end
,
Stanley
R.
Larson
(
a
Rasmussen
graduate
student
)
set
about
applying
modern
text
critical
standards
to
the
manuscripts
and
early
editions
of
the
Book
of
Mormon
as
his
thesis
project
–
which
he
completed
in
1974
.
To
that
end
,
Larson
carefully
examined
the
Original
Manuscript
(
the
one
dictated
by
Joseph
Smith
to
his
scribes
)
and
the
Printer
’s
Manuscript
(
the
copy
Oliver
Cowdery
prepared
for
the
Printer
in
1829
–
1830
)
,
and
compared
them
with
the
1st
,
2nd
,
and
3rd
editions
of
the
Book
of
Mormon
to
determine
what
sort
of
changes
had
occurred
over
time
and
to
make
judgments
as
to
which
readings
were
the
most
original
.
Larson
proceeded
to
publish
a
useful
set
of
well
-
argued
articles
on
the
phenomena
which
he
had
discovered
.
Many
of
his
observations
were
included
as
improvements
in
the
1981
LDS
edition
of
the
Book
of
Mormon
.
By
1979
,
with
the
establishment
of
the
Foundation
for
Ancient
Research
and
Mormon
Studies
(
FARMS
)
as
a
California
non-profit
research
institution
,
an
effort
led
by
Robert
F.
Smith
began
to
take
full
account
of
Larson
’s
work
and
to
publish
a
Critical
Text
of
the
Book
of
Mormon
.
Thus
was
born
the
FARMS
Critical
Text
Project
which
published
the
first
volume
of
the
3
-
volume
Book
of
Mormon
Critical
Text
in
1984
.
The
third
volume
of
that
first
edition
was
published
in
1987
,
but
was
already
being
superseded
by
a
second
,
revised
edition
of
the
entire
work
,
greatly
aided
through
the
advice
and
assistance
of
then
Yale
doctoral
candidate
Grant
Hardy
,
Dr.
Gordon
C.
Thomasson
,
Professor
John
W.
Welch
(
the
head
of
FARMS
)
,
Professor
Royal
Skousen
,
and
others
too
numerous
to
mention
here
.
However
,
these
were
merely
preliminary
steps
to
a
far
more
exacting
and
all-
encompassing
project
.
In
1988
,
with
that
preliminary
phase
of
the
project
completed
,
Professor
Skousen
took
over
as
editor
and
head
of
the
FARMS
Critical
Text
of
the
Book
of
Mormon
Project
and
proceeded
to
gather
still
scattered
fragments
of
the
Original
Manuscript
of
the
Book
of
Mormon
and
to
have
advanced
photographic
techniques
applied
to
obtain
fine
readings
from
otherwise
unreadable
pages
and
fragments
.
He
also
closely
examined
the
Printer
’s
Manuscript
(
owned
by
the
Community
of
Christ
—
RLDS
Church
in
Independence
,
Missouri
)
for
differences
in
types
of
ink
or
pencil
,
in
order
to
determine
when
and
by
whom
they
were
made
.
He
also
collated
the
various
editions
of
the
Book
of
Mormon
down
to
the
present
to
see
what
sorts
of
changes
have
been
made
through
time
.
Shemaryahu
Talmon
,
who
summarized
the
amount
of
consensus
and
genetic
relation
to
the
Urtext
of
the
Hebrew
Bible
,
concluded
that
major
divergences
which
intrinsically
affect
the
sense
are
extremely
rare
.
As
far
as
the
Hebrew
Bible
referenced
by
Old
Testament
is
concerned
,
almost
all
of
the
textual
variants
are
fairly
insignificant
and
hardly
affect
any
doctrine
.
Professor
Douglas
Stuart
states
:
"
It
is
fair
to
say
that
the
verses
,
chapters
,
and
books
of
the
Bible
would
read
largely
the
same
,
and
would
leave
the
same
impression
with
the
reader
,
even
if
one
adopted
virtually
every
possible
alternative
reading
to
those
now
serving
as
the
basis
for
current
English
translations
.
"
While
textual
criticism
developed
into
a
discipline
of
thorough
analysis
of
the
Bible
—
both
the
Hebrew
Bible
and
the
New
Testament
—
scholars
also
use
it
to
determine
the
original
content
of
classic
texts
,
such
as
Plato
's
Republic
.
There
are
far
fewer
witnesses
to
classical
texts
than
to
the
Bible
,
so
scholars
can
use
stemmatics
and
,
in
some
cases
,
copy
text
editing
.
However
,
unlike
the
New
Testament
where
the
earliest
witnesses
are
within
200
years
of
the
original
,
the
earliest
existing
manuscripts
of
most
classical
texts
were
written
about
a
millennium
after
their
composition
.
All
things
being
equal
,
textual
scholars
expect
that
a
larger
time
gap
between
an
original
and
a
manuscript
means
more
changes
in
the
text
.
Scientific
and
critical
editions
can
be
protected
by

as

The
mere
addition
of
a

or
substitution
of
a
term
with
another
one
believed
to
be
more
correct
,
usually
does
not
achieve
such
level
of
originality
/
creativity
.
All
the
notes
accounting
for
the
analysis
and
why
and
how
such
changes
have
been
made
represent

A
gramophone
record
(
phonograph
record
in
American
English
)
or
vinyl
record
,
commonly
known
as
a
"
record
"
,
is
an
analogue
sound
storage
medium
in
the
form
of
a
flat
polyvinyl
chloride
(
previously
shellac
)
disc
with
an
inscribed
,
modulated
spiral
groove
.
The
groove
usually
starts
near
the
periphery
and
ends
near
the
center
of
the
disc
.
Phonograph
records
are
generally
described
by
their
diameter
in
inches
(
12
"
,
10
"
,
7
"
)
,
the
rotational
speed
in
rpm
at
which
they
are
played
(
16
2⁄3
,
33
1⁄3
,
45
,
78
)
,
and
their
time
capacity
resulting
from
a
combination
of
those
parameters
(
LP
–
long
playing
33
1⁄3
rpm
,
SP
–
78
rpm
single
,
EP
–
12
-
inch
single
or
extended
play
,
33
or
45
rpm
)
;
their
reproductive
quality
or
level
of
fidelity
(
high
-
fidelity
,
orthophonic
,
full-
range
,
etc.
)
,
and
the
number
of
audio
channels
provided
(
mono
,
stereo
,
quad
,
etc.
)
.
The
phonograph
disc
record
was
the
primary
medium
used
for
music
reproduction
until
late
in
the
20th
century
,
replacing
the
phonograph
cylinder
record
–with
which
it
had
co-existed
from
the
late
1880s
through
to
the
1920s
–by
the
late
1920s
.
Records
retained
the
largest
market
share
even
when
new
formats
such
as
compact
cassette
were
mass-marketed
.
By
the
late
1980s
,
digital
media
,
in
the
form
of
the
compact
disc
,
had
gained
a
larger
market
share
,
and
the
vinyl
record
left
the
mainstream
in
1991
.
From
the
1990s
to
the
2010s
,
records
continued
to
be
manufactured
and
sold
on
a
much
smaller
scale
,
and
were
especially
used
by
disc
jockeys
(
DJ
)
s
,
released
by
artists
in
some
genres
,
and
listened
to
by
a
niche
market
of
audiophiles
.
The
phonograph
record
has
made
a
niche
resurgence
in
the
early
21st
century
–
9.2
million
records
were
sold
in
the
U.S.
in
2014
,
a
260
%
increase
since
2009
.
Likewise
,
in
the
UK
sales
have
increased
five
-fold
from
2009
to
2014
.
The
phonautograph
,
patented
by
Léon
Scott
in
1857
,
used
a
vibrating
diaphragm
and
stylus
to
graphically
record
sound
waves
as
tracings
on
sheets
of
paper
,
purely
for
visual
analysis
and
without
any
intent
of
playing
them
back
.
In
the
2000s
,
these
tracings
were
first
scanned
by
audio
engineers
and
digitally
converted
into
audible
sound
.
Phonautograms
of
singing
and
speech
made
by
Scott
in
1860
were
played
back
as
sound
for
the
first
time
in
2008
.
Along
with
a
tuning
fork
tone
and
unintelligible
snippets
recorded
as
early
as
1857
,
these
are
the
earliest
known
recordings
of
sound
.
In
1877
,
Thomas
Edison
invented
the
phonograph
.
Unlike
the
phonautograph
,
it
was
capable
of
both
recording
and
reproducing
sound
.
Despite
the
similarity
of
name
,
there
is
no
documentary
evidence
that
Edison
's
phonograph
was
based
on
Scott
's
phonautograph
.
Edison
first
tried
recording
sound
on
a
wax
-impregnated
paper
tape
,
with
the
idea
of
creating
a
"

"
analogous
to
the
telegraph
repeater
he
had
been
working
on
.
Although
the
visible
results
made
him
confident
that
sound
could
be
physically
recorded
and
reproduced
,
his
notes
do
not
indicate
that
he
actually
reproduced
sound
before
his
first
experiment
in
which
he
used
tinfoil
as
a
recording
medium
several
months
later
.
The
tinfoil
was
wrapped
around
a
grooved
metal
cylinder
and
a
sound-vibrated
stylus
indented
the
tinfoil
while
the
cylinder
was
rotated
.
The
recording
could
be
played
back
immediately
.
The
Scientific
American
article
that
introduced
the
tinfoil
phonograph
to
the
public
mentioned
Marey
,
Rosapelly
and
Barlow
as
well
as
Scott
as
creators
of
devices
for
recording
but
,
importantly
,
not
reproducing
sound
.
Edison
also
invented
variations
of
the
phonograph
that
used
tape
and
disc
formats
.
Numerous
applications
for
the
phonograph
were
envisioned
,
but
although
it
enjoyed
a
brief
vogue
as
a
startling
novelty
at
public
demonstrations
,
the
tinfoil
phonograph
proved
too
crude
to
be
put
to
any
practical
use
.
A
decade
later
,
Edison
developed
a
greatly
improved
phonograph
that
used
a
hollow
wax
cylinder
instead
of
a
foil
sheet
.
This
proved
to
be
both
a
better-sounding
and
far
more
useful
and
durable
device
.
The
wax
phonograph
cylinder
created
the
recorded
sound
market
at
the
end
of
the
1880s
and
dominated
it
through
the
early
years
of
the
20th
century
.
Lateral
-
cut
disc
records
were
developed
in
the
United
States
by
Emile
Berliner
,
who
named
his
system
the
"
gramophone
"
,
distinguishing
it
from
Edison
's
wax
cylinder
"
phonograph
"
and
Columbia
's
wax
cylinder
"
graphophone
"
.
Berliner
's
earliest
discs
,
first
marketed
in
1889
,
but
only
in
Europe
,
were
5
inches
(
13
cm
)
in
diameter
,
and
were
played
with
a
small
hand
-
propelled
machine
.
Both
the
records
and
the
machine
were
adequate
only
for
use
as
a
toy
or
curiosity
,
due
to
the
limited
sound
quality
.
In
the
United
States
in
1894
,
under
the
Berliner
Gramophone
trademark
,
Berliner
started
marketing
records
with
somewhat
more
substantial
entertainment
value
,
along
with
somewhat
more
substantial
gramophones
to
play
them
.
Berliner
's
records
had
poor
sound
quality
compared
to
wax
cylinders
,
but
his
manufacturing
associate
Eldridge
R.
Johnson
eventually
improved
the
sound
quality
.
Abandoning
Berliner
's
"
Gramophone
"
trademark
for
legal
reasons
,
in
1901
Johnson
's
and
Berliner
's
separate
companies
reorganized
to
form
the
Victor
Talking
Machine
Company
,
whose
products
would
come
to
dominate
the
market
for
many
years
.
Emile
Berliner
moved
his
company
to
Montreal
in
1900
.
The
factory
which
became
RCA
Victor
stills
exists
.
There
is
a
dedicated
museum
in
Montreal
for
Berliner
.
In
1901
,
10
-
inch
disc
records
were
introduced
,
followed
in
1903
by
12
-
inch
records
.
These
could
play
for
more
than
three
and
four
minutes
respectively
,
while
contemporary
cylinders
could
only
play
for
about
two
minutes
.
In
an
attempt
to
head
off
the
disc
advantage
,
Edison
introduced
the
Amberol
cylinder
in
1909
,
with
a
maximum
playing
time
of
4½
minutes
(
at
160
rpm
)
,
which
in
turn
were
superseded
by
Blue
Amberol
Records
,
which
had
a
playing
surface
made
of
celluloid
,
a
plastic
,
which
was
far
less
fragile
.
Despite
these
improvements
,
during
the
1910s
discs
decisively
won
this
early
format
war
,
although
Edison
continued
to
produce
new
Blue
Amberol
cylinders
for
an
ever-dwindling
customer
base
until
late
in
1929
.
By
1919
the
basic
patents
for
the
manufacture
of
lateral
-
cut
disc
records
had
expired
,
opening
the
field
for
countless
companies
to
produce
them
.
Analog
disc
records
would
dominate
the
home
entertainment
market
until
they
were
outsold
by
the
digital
compact
disc
in
the
late
1980s
(
which
was
in
turn
supplanted
by
digital
audio
recordings
distributed
via
online
music
stores
and
Internet
file
sharing
)
.
Early
recordings
were
made
entirely
acoustically
,
the
sound
being
collected
by
a
horn
and
piped
to
a
diaphragm
,
which
vibrated
the
cutting
stylus
.
Sensitivity
and
frequency
range
were
poor
,
and
frequency
response
was
very
irregular
,
giving
acoustic
recordings
an
instantly
recognizable
tonal
quality
.
A
singer
practically
had
to
put
his
or
her
face
in
the
recording
horn
.
Lower
-pitched
orchestral
instruments
such
as
cellos
and
double
basses
were
often
doubled
(
or
replaced
)
by
louder
wind
instruments
,
such
as
tubas
.
Standard
violins
in
orchestral
ensembles
were
commonly
replaced
by
Stroh
violins
,
which
became
popular
with
recording
studios
.
Contrary
to
popular
belief
,
if
placed
properly
and
prepared
-
for
,
drums
could
be
effectively
used
and
heard
on
even
the
earliest
jazz
and
military
band
recordings
.
The
loudest
instruments
such
as
the
drums
and
trumpets
were
positioned
the
farthest
away
from
the
collecting
horn
.
Lillian
Hardin
Armstrong
,
a
member
of
King
Oliver
's
Creole
Jazz
Band
,
which
recorded
at
Gennett
Records
in
1923
,
remembered
that
at
first
Oliver
and
his
young
second
trumpet
,
Louis
Armstrong
,
stood
next
to
each
other
and
Oliver
's
horn
could
not
be
heard
.
"
They
put
Louis
about
fifteen
feet
over
in
the
corner
,
looking
all
sad
.
"
For
fading
instrumental
parts
in
and
out
while
recording
,
some
performers
were
placed
on
a
moveable
platform
,
which
could
draw
the
performer
(
s
)
nearer
or
further
away
as
required
.

During
the
first
half
of
the
1920s
,
engineers
at
Western
Electric
,
as
well
as
independent
inventors
such
as
Orlando
Marsh
,
developed
technology
for
capturing
sound
with
a
microphone
,
amplifying
it
with
vacuum
tubes
,
then
using
the
amplified
signal
to
drive
an
electromagnetic
recording
head
.
Western
Electric
's
innovations
resulted
in
a
greatly
expanded
and
more
even
frequency
response
,
creating
a
dramatically
fuller
,
clearer
and
more
natural
-
sounding
recording
.
Distant
or
less
strong
sounds
that
were
impossible
to
record
by
the
old
methods
could
now
be
captured
.
Volume
was
now
limited
only
by
the
groove
spacing
on
the
record
and
the
limitations
of
the
intended
playback
device
.
Victor
and
Columbia
licensed
the
new
electrical
system
from
Western
Electric
and
began
issuing
electrically
recorded
discs
in
1925
.
The
first
classical
recording
was
of
Chopin
impromptus
and
Schubert
's
Litanei
by
Alfred
Cortot
for
Victor
.
Electrical
recording
preceded
electrical
home
reproduction
because
of
the
initial
high
cost
of
the
new
system
.
In
1925
,
the
Victor
company
introduced
the
Victor
Orthophonic
Victrola
,
an
acoustical
record
player
that
was
specifically
designed
to
play
electrically
recorded
discs
,
as
part
of
a
line
that
also
included
electrically
reproducing
Electrolas
.
The
acoustical
Orthophonics
ranged
in
price
from
US
$
95
to
US
$
300
,
depending
on
cabinetry
;
by
comparison
,
the
cheapest
Electrola
cost
US
$
650
,
the
price
of
a
new
Ford
automobile
in
an
era
when
clerical
jobs
paid
about
$
20
a
week
.
The
earliest
disc
records
(
1889
–
1894
)
were
made
of
various
materials
including
hard
rubber
.
Around
1895
,
a
shellac-
based
compound
was
introduced
and
became
standard
.
Exact
formulas
for
this
compound
varied
by
manufacturer
and
over
the
course
of
time
,
but
it
was
typically
composed
of
about
one
-
third
shellac
and
about
two
-thirds
mineral
filler
,
which
meant
finely
pulverized
rock
,
usually
slate
and
limestone
,
with
an
admixture
of
cotton
fibers
to
add
tensile
strength
,
carbon
black
for
color
(
without
this
,
it
tended
to
be
a
"
dirty
"
gray
or
brown
color
that
most
record
companies
considered
unattractive
)
,
and
a
very
small
amount
of
a
lubricant
to
facilitate
mold
release
during
manufacture
.
Some
makers
,
notably
Columbia
Records
,
used
a
laminated
construction
with
a
core
disc
of
coarser
material
or
fiber
.
The
production
of
shellac
records
continued
until
the
end
of
the
78
rpm
format
(
i.e.
,
the
late
1950s
in
most
developed
countries
,
but
well
into
the
1960s
in
some
other
places
)
,
but
increasingly
less
abrasive
formulations
were
used
during
its
declining
years
and
very
late
examples
in
truly
like
-
new
condition
can
have
as
low
noise
levels
as
vinyl
.
Flexible
or
so-called
"
unbreakable
"
records
made
of
unusual
materials
were
introduced
by
a
number
of
manufacturers
at
various
times
during
the
78
rpm
era
.
In
the
UK
,
Nicole
records
,
made
of
celluloid
or
a
similar
substance
coated
onto
a
cardboard
core
disc
,
were
produced
for
a
few
years
beginning
in
1904
,
but
they
suffered
from
an
exceptionally
high
level
of
surface
noise
.
In
the
United
States
,
Columbia
Records
introduced
flexible
,
fiber-
cored
"
Marconi
Velvet
Tone
Record
"
pressings
in
1907
,
but
the
advantages
and
longevity
of
their
relatively
noiseless
surfaces
depended
on
the
scrupulous
use
of
special
gold
-
plated
Marconi
Needles
and
the
product
was
not
a
success
.
Thin
,
flexible
plastic
records
such
as
the
German
Phonycord
and
the
British
Filmophone
and
Goodson
records
appeared
around
1930
but
also
did
not
last
long
.
The
contemporary
French
Pathé
Cellodiscs
,
made
of
a
very
thin
black
plastic
,
which
uncannily
resembles
the
vinyl
"
sound
sheet
"
magazine
inserts
of
the
1965
–
1985
era
,
were
similarly
short-lived
.
In
the
US
,
Hit
of
the
Week
records
,
made
of
a
patented
translucent
plastic
called
Durium
coated
on
a
heavy
brown
paper
base
,
were
introduced
in
early
1930
.
A
new
issue
came
out
every
week
and
they
were
sold
at
newsstands
like
a
weekly
magazine
.
Although
inexpensive
and
commercially
successful
at
first
,
they
soon
fell
victim
to
the
Great
Depression
and
production
in
the
US
ended
in
1932
.
Related
Durium
records
continued
to
be
made
somewhat
later
in
the
UK
and
elsewhere
,
and
as
remarkably
late
as
1950
in
Italy
,
where
the
name
"
Durium
"
survived
far
into
the
LP
era
as
a
trademark
on
ordinary
vinyl
records
.
Despite
all
these
attempts
at
innovation
,
shellac
compounds
continued
to
be
used
for
the
overwhelming
majority
of
commercial
78
rpm
records
during
the
lifetime
of
the
format
.
In
1931
,
RCA
Victor
introduced
their
vinyl-
based
Victrolac
compound
as
a
material
for
some
unusual
-
format
and
special
-
purpose
records
.
By
the
end
of
the
1930s
vinyl's
advantages
of
light
weight
,
relative
unbreakability
and
low
surface
noise
had
made
it
the
material
of
choice
for
prerecorded
radio
programming
and
other
critical
applications
.
When
it
came
to
ordinary
78
rpm
records
,
however
,
the
much
higher
cost
of
the
raw
material
,
as
well
as
its
vulnerability
to
the
heavy
pickups
and
crudely
mass
-produced
steel
needles
still
commonly
used
in
home
record
players
,
made
its
general
substitution
for
shellac
impractical
at
that
time
.
During
the
Second
World
War
,
the
United
States
Armed
Forces
produced
thousands
of
12
-
inch
vinyl
78
rpm
V-
Discs
for
use
by
the
troops
overseas
.
After
the
war
,
the
wider
use
of
vinyl
became
more
practical
as
new
record
players
with
relatively
lightweight
crystal
pickups
and
precision
-
ground
styli
made
of
sapphire
or
an
exotic
osmium
alloy
proliferated
.
In
late
1945
,
RCA
Victor
began
offering
special
transparent
red
vinyl
De
Luxe
pressings
of
some
classical
78s
,
at
a
de
luxe
price
.
Later
,
Decca
Records
introduced
vinyl
Deccalite
78s
,
while
other
record
companies
came
up
with
vinyl
concoctions
such
as
Metrolite
,
Merco
Plastic
and
Sav-o-
flex
,
but
these
were
mainly
used
to
produce
"
unbreakable
"
children
's
records
and
special
thin
vinyl
DJ
pressings
for
shipment
to
radio
stations
.
In
the
1890s
,
the
recording
formats
of
the
earliest
(
toy
)
discs
were
mainly
12.5
cm
(
nominally
five
inches
)
in
diameter
;
by
the
mid-1890s
,
the
discs
were
usually
7
in
(
nominally
17.5
cm
)
in
diameter
.
By
1910
the
10
-
inch
(
25.4
cm
)
record
was
by
far
the
most
popular
standard
,
holding
about
three
minutes
of
music
or
other
entertainment
on
a
side
.
From
1903
onwards
,
12
-
inch
records
(
30.5
cm
)
were
also
sold
commercially
,
mostly
of
classical
music
or
operatic
selections
,
with
four
to
five
minutes
of
music
per
side
.
Victor
,
Brunswick
and
Columbia
also
issued
12
-
inch
popular
medleys
,
usually
spotlighting
a
Broadway
show
score
.
However
,
other
sizes
did
appear
.
Eight
-
inch
discs
with
a
2
-
inch
-
diameter
(
51
mm
)
label
became
popular
for
about
a
decade
in
Britain
,
but
they
cannot
be
played
in
full
on
most
modern
record
players
because
the
tone
arm
cannot
play
far
enough
in
toward
the
center
without
modification
of
the
equipment
.
The
playing
time
of
a
phonograph
record
depended
on
the
turntable
speed
and
the
groove
spacing
.
At
the
beginning
of
the
20th
century
,
the
early
discs
played
for
two
minutes
,
the
same
as
early
cylinder
records
.
The
12
-
inch
disc
,
introduced
by
Victor
in
1903
,
increased
the
playing
time
to
three
and
a
half
minutes
.
Because
a
10
-
inch
78
rpm
record
could
hold
about
three
minutes
of
sound
per
side
and
the
10
-
inch
size
was
the
standard
size
for
popular
music
,
almost
all
popular
recordings
were
limited
to
around
three
minutes
in
length
.
For
example
,
when
King
Oliver
's
Creole
Jazz
Band
,
including
Louis
Armstrong
on
his
first
recordings
,
recorded
13
sides
at
Gennett
Records
in
Richmond
,
Indiana
,
in
1923
,
one
side
was
2:09
and
four
sides
were
2:52
–
2:59
.
In
January
1938
,
Milt
Gabler
started
recording
for
his
new
label
,
Commodore
Records
,
and
to
allow
for
longer
continuous
performances
,
he
recorded
some
12
-
inch
records
.
Eddie
Condon
explained
:
"
Gabler
realized
that
a
jam
session
needs
room
for
development
.
"
The
first
two
12
-
inch
recordings
did
not
take
advantage
of
the
extra
length
:
"
Carnegie
Drag
"
was
3:15
;
"
Carnegie
Jump
"
,
2:41
.
But
at
the
second
session
,
on
April
30
,
the
two
12
-
inch
recordings
were
longer
:
"
Embraceable
You
"
was
4:05
;
"
Serenade
to
a
Shylock
"
,
4:32
.
Another
way
around
the
time
limitation
was
to
issue
a
selection
on
both
sides
of
a
single
record
.
Vaudeville
stars
Gallagher
and
Shean
recorded
"
Mr.
Gallagher
and
Mr.
Shean
"
,
written
by
Irving
and
Jack
Kaufman
,
as
two
sides
of
a
10
-
inch
78
in
1922
for
Cameo
.
An
obvious
workaround
for
longer
recordings
was
to
release
a
set
of
records
.
An
early
multi-record
release
was
in
1903
,
when
HMV
in
England
made
the
first
complete
recording
of
an
opera
,
Verdi's
Ernani
,
on
40
single
-sided
discs
.
In
1940
,
Commodore
released
Eddie
Condon
and
his
Band
's
recording
of
"
A
Good
Man
Is
Hard
to
Find
"
in
four
parts
,
issued
on
both
sides
of
two
12
-
inch
78s
.
This
limitation
on
the
duration
of
recordings
persisted
from
1910
until
the
invention
of
the
LP
record
,
in
1948
.
In
popular
music
,
this
time
limitation
of
about
3:30
on
a
10
-
inch
78
rpm
record
meant
that
singers
usually
did
not
release
long
pieces
on
record
.
One
exception
is
Frank
Sinatra
's
recording
of
Rodgers
and
Hammerstein's
"
Soliloquy
"
,
from
Carousel
,
made
on
May
28
,
1946
.
Because
it
ran
7:57
,
longer
than
both
sides
of
a
standard
78
rpm
10
-
inch
record
,
it
was
released
on
Columbia
's
Masterwork
label
(
the
classical
division
)
as
two
sides
of
a
12
-
inch
record
.
The
same
was
true
of
John
Raitt
's
performance
of
the
song
on
the
original
cast
album
of
Carousel
,
which
had
been
issued
on
a
78
-
rpm
album
set
by
American
Decca
in
1945
.
German
record
company
Odeon
is
often
said
to
have
pioneered
the
album
in
1909
when
it
released
the
Nutcracker
Suite
by
Tchaikovsky
on
4
double
-sided
discs
in
a
specially
designed
package
.
(
It
is
not
indicated
what
size
the
records
are
.
)
However
,
Deutsche
Grammophon
had
produced
an
album
for
its
complete
recording
of
the
opera
Carmen
in
the
previous
year
.
The
practice
of
issuing
albums
does
not
seem
to
have
been
widely
taken
up
by
other
record
companies
for
many
years
;
however
,
HMV
provided
an
album
,
with
a
pictorial
cover
,
for
the
1917
recording
of
The
Mikado
(
Gilbert
&
Sullivan
)
.
By
about
1910
,
[
note
1
]
bound
collections
of
empty
sleeves
with
a
paperboard
or
leather
cover
,
similar
to
a
photograph
album
,
were
sold
as
record
albums
that
customers
could
use
to
store
their
records
(
the
term
"
record
album
"
was
printed
on
some
covers
)
.
These
albums
came
in
both
10
-
inch
and
12
-
inch
sizes
.
The
covers
of
these
bound
books
were
wider
and
taller
than
the
records
inside
,
allowing
the
record
album
to
be
placed
on
a
shelf
upright
,
like
a
book
,
suspending
the
fragile
records
above
the
shelf
and
protecting
them
.
In
the
1930s
,
record
companies
began
issuing
collections
of
78
rpm
records
by
one
performer
or
of
one
type
of
music
in
specially
assembled
albums
,
typically
with
artwork
on
the
front
cover
and
liner
notes
on
the
back
or
inside
cover
.
Most
albums
included
three
or
four
records
,
with
two
sides
each
,
making
six
or
eight
tunes
per
album
.
When
the
12
-
inch
vinyl
LP
era
began
in
1949
,
the
single
record
often
had
the
same
or
similar
number
of
tunes
as
a
typical
album
of
78s
,
and
was
still
often
referred
to
as
an
"
album
"
.
For
collectable
or
nostalgia
purposes
,
or
for
the
benefit
of
higher
-quality
audio
playback
provided
by
the
78
rpm
speed
with
newer
vinyl
records
and
their
lightweight
stylus
pickups
,
a
small
number
of
78
rpm
records
have
been
released
since
the
major
labels
ceased
production
.
One
of
the
first
attempts
at
this
was
in
the
1950s
,
when
inventor
Ewing
Dunbar
Nunn
founded
the
label
Audiophile
Records
,
which
released
,
in
addition
to
standard
33
1/3
rpm
LPs
,
78
rpm-mastered
albums
that
were
microgroove
and
pressed
on
vinyl
(
as
opposed
to
traditional
78s
,
with
their
shellac
composition
and
wider
3
-
mil
sized
grooves
)
.
This
was
done
by
the
label
mainly
to
take
advantage
of
the
wider
audio
frequency
response
that
faster
speeds
like
78
rpm
can
provide
for
vinyl
microgroove
records
,
hence
the
label
's
name
(
obviously
catering
to
the
audiophiles
of
the
1950s
"
hi-
fi
"
era
,
when
stereo
gear
could
provide
a
much
wider
range
of
audio
than
before
)
.
Also
in
the
late
1950s
,
Bell
Records
released
a
few
budget-
priced
7
"
microgrooved
records
at
78
rpm
.
In
1968
,
Reprise
planned
to
release
a
series
of
78
rpm
singles
from
their
artists
on
their
label
at
the
time
,
called
the
Reprise
Speed
Series
.
Only
one
disc
actually
saw
release
,
Randy
Newman
's
I
Think
It
's
Going
to
Rain
Today
,
a
track
from
his
self-titled
debut
album
(
with
The
Beehive
State
on
the
flipside
)
.
Reprise
did
not
proceed
further
with
the
series
due
to
a
lack
of
sales
for
the
single
,
and
a
lack
of
general
interest
in
the
concept
.
Guitarist
&
vocalist
Leon
Redbone
released
a
promotional
78
rpm
record
in
1978
featuring
two
songs
(
Alabama
Jubilee
and
Please
Do
n't
Talk
About
Me
When
I'm
Gone
)
from
his
Champagne
Charlie
album
.
In
1980
Stiff
Records
in
the
United
Kingdom
issued
a
78
by
Joe
"
King
"
Carrasco
containing
the
songs
Buena
(
Spanish
for
"
good
,
"
with
the
alternate
spelling
"
Bueno
"
on
the
label
)
and
Tuff
Enuff
.
Underground
comic
cartoonist
and
78
rpm
record
collector
Robert
Crumb
released
three
discs
with
his
Cheap
Suit
Serenaders
in
the
1980s
.
In
the
1990s
Rhino
Records
issued
a
series
of
boxed
sets
of
78
rpm
reissues
of
early
rock
and
roll
hits
,
intended
for
owners
of
vintage
jukeboxes
.
This
was
a
disaster
because
Rhino
did
not
warn
customers
that
their
records
were
made
of
vinyl
,
and
that
the
vintage
78
RPM
juke
boxes
were
designed
with
heavy
tone
arms
and
steel
needles
to
play
the
hard
shellac
records
of
their
time
.
This
failure
to
warn
customers
gave
the
Rhino
78
records
a
bad
reputation
,
[
citation
needed
]
as
they
were
destroyed
by
old
juke
boxes
and
old
record
players
but
played
very
well
on
newer
78
-
capable
turntables
with
modern
lightweight
tone
arms
and
jewel
needles
.
In
1931
,
RCA
Victor
launched
the
first
commercially
available
vinyl
long-
playing
record
,
marketed
as
program-transcription
discs
.
These
revolutionary
discs
were
designed
for
playback
at
33
1⁄3
rpm
and
pressed
on
a
30
cm
diameter
flexible
plastic
disc
,
with
a
duration
of
about
ten
minutes
playing
time
per
side
.
RCA
Victor
's
early
introduction
of
a
long-play
disc
was
a
commercial
failure
for
several
reasons
including
the
lack
of
affordable
,
reliable
consumer
playback
equipment
and
consumer
wariness
during
the
Great
Depression
.
Because
of
financial
hardships
that
plagued
the
recording
industry
during
that
period
(
and
RCA
's
own
parched
revenues
)
,
Victor
's
long
-
playing
records
were
discontinued
by
early
1933
.
Vinyl
's
lower
surface
noise
level
than
shellac
was
not
forgotten
,
nor
was
its
durability
.
In
the
late
1930s
,
radio
commercials
and
pre-recorded
radio
programs
being
sent
to
disc
jockeys
started
being
stamped
in
vinyl
,
so
they
would
not
break
in
the
mail
.
In
the
mid-1940s
,
special
DJ
copies
of
records
started
being
made
of
vinyl
also
,
for
the
same
reason
.
These
were
all
78
rpm
.
During
and
after
World
War
II
,
when
shellac
supplies
were
extremely
limited
,
some
78
rpm
records
were
pressed
in
vinyl
instead
of
shellac
,
particularly
the
six-minute
12
-
inch
(
30
cm
)
78
rpm
records
produced
by
V-Disc
for
distribution
to
United
States
troops
in
World
War
II
.
In
the
1940s
,
radio
transcriptions
,
which
were
usually
on
16
-
inch
records
,
but
sometimes
12
-
inch
,
were
always
made
of
vinyl
,
but
cut
at
33
1⁄3
rpm
.
Shorter
transcriptions
were
often
cut
at
78
rpm
.
Beginning
in
1939
,
Dr.
Peter
Goldmark
and
his
staff
at
Columbia
Records
and
at
CBS
Laboratories
undertook
efforts
to
address
problems
of
recording
and
playing
back
narrow
grooves
and
developing
an
inexpensive
,
reliable
consumer
playback
system
.
It
took
about
eight
years
of
study
,
except
when
it
was
suspended
because
of
World
War
II
.
Finally
,
the
12-
inch
(
30
cm
)
Long
Play
(
LP
)
33
1⁄3
rpm
microgroove
record
album
was
introduced
by
the
Columbia
Record
Company
at
a
New
York
press
conference
on
June
18
,
1948
.
Unwilling
to
accept
and
license
Columbia
's
system
,
in
February
1949
RCA
Victor
,
in
cooperation
of
its
parent
,
the
Radio
Corporation
of
America
,
released
the
first
45
rpm
single
,
7
inches
in
diameter
with
a
large
center
hole
.
The
45
rpm
player
included
a
changing
mechanism
that
allowed
multiple
disks
to
be
stacked
,
much
as
a
conventional
changer
handled
78s
.
The
short
playing
time
of
a
single
45
rpm
side
meant
that
long
works
,
such
as
symphonies
,
had
to
be
released
on
multiple
45s
instead
of
a
single
LP
,
but
RCA
claimed
that
the
new
high-speed
changer
rendered
side
breaks
so
brief
as
to
be
inaudible
or
inconsequential
.
Early
45
rpm
records
were
made
from
either
vinyl
or
polystyrene
.
They
had
a
playing
time
of
eight
minutes
.
One
early
attempt
at
lengthening
the
playing
time
should
be
mentioned
.
At
least
one
manufacturer
in
the
early
1920s
,
World
Records
,
produced
records
that
played
at
a
constant
linear
velocity
,
controlled
by
Noel
Pemberton
Billing
's
patented
add
-
on
governor
device
.
As
these
were
played
from
the
outside
to
the
inside
,
the
rotational
speed
of
the
records
increased
as
reproduction
progressed
.
This
action
is
similar
(
although
in
reverse
)
to
that
on
the
modern
compact
disc
and
the
CLV
version
of
its
predecessor
,
the
Philips
Laser
Disc
.
In
1925
,
78.26
rpm
was
chosen
as
the
standard
because
of
the
introduction
of
the
electrically
powered
synchronous
turntable
motor
.
This
motor
ran
at
3600
rpm
,
such
that
a
46:1
gear
ratio
would
produce
78.26
rpm
.
In
parts
of
the
world
that
used
50
Hz
current
,
the
standard
was
77.92
rpm
(
3,000
rpm
with
a
77:2
ratio
)
,
which
was
also
the
speed
at
which
a
strobe
disc
with
77
lines
would
"
stand
still
"
in
50
Hz
light
(
92
lines
for
60
Hz
)
.
After
World
War
II
these
records
were
retroactively
known
as
78s
,
to
distinguish
them
from
other
newer
disc
record
formats
.
Earlier
they
were
just
called
records
,
or
when
there
was
a
need
to
distinguish
them
from
cylinders
,
disc
records
.
The
older
78
format
continued
to
be
mass-produced
alongside
the
newer
formats
using
new
materials
until
about
1960
in
the
U.S.
,
and
in
a
few
countries
,
such
as
India
(
where
some
Beatles
recordings
were
issued
on
78
)
,
into
the
1960s
.
For
example
,
Columbia
Records
'
last
reissue
of
Frank
Sinatra
songs
on
78
rpm
records
was
an
album
called
Young
at
Heart
,
issued
November
1
,
1954
.
As
late
as
the
1970s
,
some
children
's
records
were
released
at
the
78
rpm
speed
.
In
the
United
Kingdom
,
the
78
rpm
single
lasted
longer
than
in
the
United
States
and
the
45
rpm
took
longer
to
become
popular
.
The
78
rpm
was
overtaken
in
popularity
by
the
45
rpm
in
the
late
1950s
,
as
teenagers
became
increasingly
affluent
.
Some
of
Elvis
Presley
's
early
singles
on
Sun
Records
might
have
sold
more
copies
on
78
than
on
45
.
This
is
because
the
majority
of
those
sales
in
1954
–
55
were
to
the
"
hillbilly
"
market
in
the
South
and
Southwestern
United
States
,
where
replacing
the
family
78
rpm
player
with
a
new
45
rpm
player
was
a
luxury
few
could
afford
at
the
time
.
By
the
end
of
1957
,
RCA
Victor
announced
that
78s
accounted
for
less
than
10
%
of
Presley
's
singles
sales
,
essentially
announcing
the
death
throes
of
the
78
rpm
format
.
The
last
Presley
single
released
on
78
in
the
United
States
was
RCA
Victor
20
-
7410
,
I
Got
Stung
/
One
Night
(
1958
)
,
while
the
last
78
in
the
UK
was
RCA
1194
,
A
Mess
Of
Blues
/
Girl
Of
My
Best
Friend
(
1960
)
.
After
World
War
II
,
two
new
competing
formats
came
onto
the
market
and
gradually
replaced
the
standard
"
78
"
:
the
33
1⁄3
rpm
(
often
just
referred
to
as
the
33
rpm
)
,
and
the
45
rpm
(
see
above
)
.
The
33
1⁄3
rpm
LP
(
for
"
long-play
"
)
format
was
developed
by
Columbia
Records
and
marketed
in
June
1948
.
RCA
Victor
developed
the
45
rpm
format
and
marketed
it
in
March
1949
,
each
pursuing
their
own
r&d
in
secret
.
Both
types
of
new
disc
used
narrower
grooves
,
intended
to
be
played
with
smaller
stylus
—
typically
0.001
inches
(
25
µ
m
)
wide
,
compared
to
0.003
inches
(
76
µ
m
)
for
a
78
—
so
the
new
records
were
sometimes
called
Microgroove
.
In
the
mid-1950s
all
record
companies
agreed
to
a
common
recording
standard
called
RIAA
equalization
.
Prior
to
the
establishment
of
the
standard
each
company
used
its
own
preferred
standard
,
requiring
discriminating
listeners
to
use
pre-amplifiers
with
multiple
selectable
equalization
curves
.
Some
recordings
,
such
as
books
for
the
blind
,
were
pressed
at
16
2⁄3
rpm
.
Prestige
Records
released
jazz
records
in
this
format
in
the
late
1950s
;
for
example
,
two
of
their
Miles
Davis
albums
were
paired
together
in
this
format
.
Peter
Goldmark
,
the
man
who
developed
the
33
1⁄3
rpm
record
,
developed
the
Highway
Hi-Fi
16
2⁄3
rpm
record
to
be
played
in
Chrysler
automobiles
,
but
poor
performance
of
the
system
and
weak
implementation
by
Chrysler
and
Columbia
led
to
the
demise
of
the
16
2⁄3
rpm
records
.
Subsequently
,
the
16
2⁄3
rpm
speed
was
used
for
narrated
publications
for
the
blind
and
visually
impaired
,
and
were
never
widely
commercially
available
,
although
it
was
common
to
see
new
turntable
models
with
a
16
rpm
speed
setting
produced
as
late
as
the
1970s
.
The
commercial
rivalry
between
RCA
Victor
and
Columbia
Records
led
to
RCA
Victor
's
introduction
of
what
it
had
intended
to
be
a
competing
vinyl
format
,
the
7-
inch
(
175
mm
)
45
rpm
disc
.
For
a
two
-year
period
from
1948
to
1950
,
record
companies
and
consumers
faced
uncertainty
over
which
of
these
formats
would
ultimately
prevail
in
what
was
known
as
the
"
War
of
the
Speeds
"
.
(
See
also
format
war
.
)
In
1949
Capitol
and
Decca
adopted
the
new
LP
format
and
RCA
gave
in
and
issued
its
first
LP
in
January
1950
.
The
45
rpm
size
was
gaining
in
popularity
,
too
,
and
Columbia
issued
its
first
45s
in
February
1951
.
By
1954
,
200
million
45s
had
been
sold
.
Eventually
the
12-
inch
(
300
mm
)
33
1⁄3
rpm
LP
prevailed
as
the
predominant
format
for
musical
albums
,
and
10
-
inch
LPs
were
no
longer
issued
.
The
last
Columbia
Records
reissue
of
any
Frank
Sinatra
songs
on
a
10
-
inch
LP
record
was
an
album
called
Hall
of
Fame
,
CL
2600
,
issued
on
October
26
,
1956
,
containing
six
songs
,
one
each
by
Tony
Bennett
,
Rosemary
Clooney
,
Johnnie
Ray
,
Frank
Sinatra
,
Doris
Day
,
and
Frankie
Laine
.
The
10
-
inch
LP
however
had
a
longer
life
in
the
United
Kingdom
,
where
important
early
British
rock
and
roll
albums
such
as
Lonnie
Donegan
's
Lonnie
Donegan
Showcase
and
Billy
Fury
's
The
Sound
of
Fury
were
released
in
that
form
.
The
7-
inch
(
175
mm
)
45
rpm
disc
or
"
single
"
established
a
significant
niche
for
shorter
duration
discs
,
typically
containing
one
item
on
each
side
.
The
45
rpm
discs
typically
emulated
the
playing
time
of
the
former
78
rpm
discs
,
while
the
12
-
inch
LP
discs
eventually
provided
up
to
one
half
-hour
of
recorded
material
per
side
.
The
45
rpm
discs
also
came
in
a
variety
known
as
extended
play
(
EP
)
,
which
achieved
up
to
10
–15
minutes
play
at
the
expense
of
attenuating
(
and
possibly
compressing
)
the
sound
to
reduce
the
width
required
by
the
groove
.
EP
discs
were
cheaper
to
produce
,
and
were
used
in
cases
where
unit
sales
were
likely
to
be
more
limited
or
to
reissue
LP
albums
on
the
smaller
format
for
those
people
who
had
only
45
rpm
players
.
LP
albums
could
be
purchased
1
EP
at
a
time
,
with
four
items
per
EP
,
or
in
a
boxed
set
with
3
EPs
or
12
items
.
The
large
center
hole
on
45s
allows
for
easier
handling
by
jukebox
mechanisms
.
EPs
were
generally
discontinued
by
the
late
1950s
in
the
U.S.
as
three
-
and
four-speed
record
players
replaced
the
individual
45
players
.
One
indication
of
the
decline
of
the
45
rpm
EP
is
that
the
last
Columbia
Records
reissue
of
Frank
Sinatra
songs
on
45
rpm
EP
records
,
called
Frank
Sinatra
(
Columbia
B
-2641
)
was
issued
on
December
7
,
1959
.
The
EP
lasted
considerably
longer
in
Europe
,
and
was
a
popular
format
during
the
1960s
for
recordings
by
artists
such
as
Serge
Gainsbourg
and
the
Beatles
.
From
the
mid-1950s
through
the
1960s
,
in
the
U.S.
the
common
home
record
player
or
"
stereo
"
(
after
the
introduction
of
stereo
recording
)
would
typically
have
had
these
features
:
a
three
-
or
four-speed
player
(
78
,
45
,
33
1⁄3
,
and
sometimes
16
2⁄3
rpm
)
;
with
changer
,
a
tall
spindle
that
would
hold
several
records
and
automatically
drop
a
new
record
on
top
of
the
previous
one
when
it
had
finished
playing
,
a
combination
cartridge
with
both
78
and
microgroove
styli
and
a
way
to
flip
between
the
two
;
and
some
kind
of
adapter
for
playing
the
45s
with
their
larger
center
hole
.
The
adapter
could
be
a
small
solid
circle
that
fit
onto
the
bottom
of
the
spindle
(
meaning
only
one
45
could
be
played
at
a
time
)
or
a
larger
adaptor
that
fit
over
the
entire
spindle
,
permitting
a
stack
of
45s
to
be
played
.
RCA
45s
were
also
adapted
to
the
smaller
spindle
of
an
LP
player
with
a
plastic
snap
-
in
insert
known
as
a
"
spider
"
.
These
inserts
,
commissioned
by
RCA
president
David
Sarnoff
and
invented
by
Thomas
Hutchison
,
were
prevalent
starting
in
the
1960s
,
selling
in
the
tens
of
millions
per
year
during
the
45
rpm
heyday
.
In
countries
outside
the
U.S.
,
45s
often
had
the
smaller
album-sized
holes
,
e.g.
,
Australia
and
New
Zealand
,
or
as
in
the
United
Kingdom
,
especially
before
the
1970s
,
the
disc
had
a
small
hole
within
a
circular
central
section
held
only
by
three
or
four
lands
so
that
it
could
be
easily
punched
out
if
desired
(
typically
for
use
in
jukeboxes
)
.
The
term
"
high
fidelity
"
was
coined
in
the
1920s
by
some
manufacturers
of
radio
receivers
and
phonographs
to
differentiate
their
better
-sounding
products
claimed
as
providing
"
perfect
"
sound
reproduction
.
The
term
began
to
be
used
by
some
audio
engineers
and
consumers
through
the
1930s
and
1940s
.
After
1949
a
variety
of
improvements
in
recording
and
playback
technologies
,
especially
stereo
recordings
,
which
became
widely
available
in
1958
,
gave
a
boost
to
the
"
hi-
fi
"
classification
of
products
,
leading
to
sales
of
individual
components
for
the
home
such
as
amplifiers
,
loudspeakers
,
phonographs
,
and
tape
players
.
High
Fidelity
and
Audio
were
two
magazines
that
hi-fi
consumers
and
engineers
could
read
for
reviews
of
playback
equipment
and
recordings
.
Stereophonic
sound
recording
,
which
attempts
to
provide
a
more
natural
listening
experience
by
reproducing
the
spatial
locations
of
sound
sources
in
the
horizontal
plane
,
was
the
natural
extension
to
monophonic
recording
,
and
attracted
various
alternative
engineering
attempts
.
The
ultimately
dominant
"
45/45
"
stereophonic
record
system
was
invented
by
Alan
Blumlein
of
EMI
in
1931
and
patented
the
same
year
.
EMI
cut
the
first
stereo
test
discs
using
the
system
in
1933
(
see
Bell
Labs
Stereo
Experiments
of
1933
)
although
the
system
was
not
exploited
commercially
until
much
later
.
The
development
of
quadraphonic
records
was
announced
in
1971
.
These
recorded
four
separate
sound
signals
.
This
was
achieved
on
the
two
stereo
channels
by
electronic
matrixing
,
where
the
additional
channels
were
combined
into
the
main
signal
.
When
the
records
were
played
,
phase-detection
circuits
in
the
amplifiers
were
able
to
decode
the
signals
into
four
separate
channels
.
There
were
two
main
systems
of
matrixed
quadraphonic
records
produced
,
confusingly
named
SQ
(
by
CBS
)
and
QS
(
by
Sansui
)
.
They
proved
commercially
unsuccessful
,
but
were
an
important
precursor
to
later
surround
-
sound
systems
,
as
seen
in
SACD
and
home
cinema
today
.
A
different
format
,
CD
-4
(
not
to
be
confused
with
compact
disc
)
,
by
RCA
,
encoded
the
front-rear
difference
information
on
an
ultrasonic
carrier
,
which
required
a
special
wideband
cartridge
to
capture
it
on
carefully
calibrated
pickup
arm
/
turntable
combinations
.
CD
-
4
was
even
less
successful
than
the
two
matrixed
formats
.
(
A
further
problem
was
that
no
cutting
heads
were
available
that
could
handle
the
HF
information
.
That
was
remedied
by
cutting
at
half
the
speed
.
Later
,
the
special
half
-speed
cutting
heads
and
equalization
techniques
were
employed
to
get
a
wider
frequency
response
in
stereo
with
reduced
distortion
and
greater
headroom
.
)
Under
the
direction
of
recording
engineer
C.
Robert
Fine
,
Mercury
Records
initiated
a
minimalist
single
microphone
monaural
recording
technique
in
1951
.
The
first
record
,
a
Chicago
Symphony
Orchestra
performance
of
Pictures
at
an
Exhibition
,
conducted
by
Rafael
Kubelik
,
was
described
as
"
being
in
the
living
presence
of
the
orchestra
"
by
The
New
York
Times
music
critic
.
The
series
of
records
was
then
named
Mercury
Living
Presence
.
In
1955
,
Mercury
began
three
-
channel
stereo
recordings
,
still
based
on
the
principle
of
the
single
microphone
.
The
center
(
single
)
microphone
was
of
paramount
importance
,
with
the
two
side
mics
adding
depth
and
space
.
Record
masters
were
cut
directly
from
a
three
-
track
to
two
-track
mixdown
console
,
with
all
editing
of
the
master
tapes
done
on
the
original
three
-
tracks
.
In
1961
,
Mercury
enhanced
this
technique
with
three
-
microphone
stereo
recordings
using
35
mm
magnetic
film
instead
of
half
-
inch
tape
for
recording
.
The
greater
thickness
and
width
of
35
mm
magnetic
film
prevented
tape
layer
print-through
and
pre-echo
and
gained
extended
frequency
range
and
transient
response
.
The
Mercury
Living
Presence
recordings
were
remastered
to
CD
in
the
1990s
by
the
original
producer
,
Wilma
Cozart
Fine
,
using
the
same
method
of
3
-
to
-
2
mix
directly
to
the
master
recorder
.
Through
the
1960s
,
1970s
,
and
1980s
,
various
methods
to
improve
the
dynamic
range
of
mass
-produced
records
involved
highly
advanced
disc
cutting
equipment
.
These
techniques
,
marketed
,
to
name
two
,
as
the
CBS
DisComputer
and
Teldec
Direct
Metal
Mastering
,
were
used
to
reduce
inner-groove
distortion
.
RCA
Victor
introduced
another
system
to
reduce
dynamic
range
and
achieve
a
groove
with
less
surface
noise
under
the
commercial
name
of
Dynagroove
.
Two
main
elements
were
combined
:
another
disk
material
with
less
surface
noise
in
the
groove
and
dynamic
compression
for
masking
background
noise
.
Sometimes
this
was
called
"
diaphragming
"
the
source
material
and
not
favoured
by
some
music
lovers
for
its
unnatural
side
effects
.
Both
elements
were
reflected
in
the
brandname
of
Dynagroove
,
described
elsewhere
in
more
detail
.
It
also
used
the
earlier
advanced
method
of
forward
-
looking
control
on
groove
spacing
with
respect
to
volume
of
sound
and
position
on
the
disk
.
Lower
recorded
volume
used
closer
spacing
;
higher
recorded
volume
used
wider
spacing
,
especially
with
lower
frequencies
.
Also
,
the
higher
track
density
at
lower
volumes
enabled
disk
recordings
to
end
farther
away
from
the
disk
center
than
usual
,
helping
to
reduce
endtrack
distortion
even
further
.
Also
in
the
late
1970s
,
"
direct-
to
-
disc
"
records
were
produced
,
aimed
at
an
audiophile
niche
market
.
These
completely
bypassed
the
use
of
magnetic
tape
in
favor
of
a
"
purist
"
transcription
directly
to
the
master
lacquer
disc
.
Also
during
this
period
,
half
-
speed
mastered
and
"
original
master
"
records
were
released
,
using
expensive
state
-
of
-
the
-
art
technology
.
A
further
late
1970s
development
was
the
Disco
Eye
-
Cued
system
used
mainly
on
Motown
12
-
inch
singles
released
between
1978
and
1980
.
The
introduction
,
drum-breaks
,
or
choruses
of
a
track
were
indicated
by
widely
separated
grooves
,
giving
a
visual
cue
to
DJs
mixing
the
records
.
The
appearance
of
these
records
is
similar
to
an
LP
,
but
they
only
contain
one
track
each
side
.
The
mid-1970s
saw
the
introduction
of
dbx-encoded
records
,
again
for
the
audiophile
niche
market
.
These
were
completely
incompatible
with
standard
record
playback
preamplifiers
,
relying
on
the
dbx
compandor
encoding
/
decoding
scheme
to
greatly
increase
dynamic
range
(
dbx
encoded
disks
were
recorded
with
the
dynamic
range
compressed
by
a
factor
of
two
in
dB
:
quiet
sounds
were
meant
to
be
played
back
at
low
gain
and
loud
sounds
were
meant
to
be
played
back
at
high
gain
,
via
automatic
gain
control
in
the
playback
equipment
;
this
reduced
the
effect
of
surface
noise
on
quiet
passages
)
.
A
similar
and
very
short-lived
scheme
involved
using
the
CBS
-
developed
"
CX
"
noise
reduction
encoding
/
decoding
scheme
.
ELPJ
,
a
Japanese
-
based
company
,
sells
a
laser
turntable
that
uses
a
laser
to
read
vinyl
discs
optically
,
without
physical
contact
.
The
laser
turntable
eliminates
record
wear
and
the
possibility
of
accidental
scratches
,
which
degrade
the
sound
,
but
its
expense
limits
use
primarily
to
digital
archiving
of
analog
records
,
and
the
laser
does
not
play
back
colored
vinyl
or
picture
discs
.
Various
other
laser
-
based
turntables
were
tried
during
the
1990s
,
but
while
a
laser
reads
the
groove
very
accurately
,
since
it
does
not
touch
the
record
,
the
dust
that
vinyl
attracts
due
to
static
electric
charge
is
not
mechanically
pushed
out
of
the
groove
,
worsening
sound
quality
in
casual
use
compared
to
conventional
stylus
playback
.
In
some
ways
similar
to
the
laser
turntable
is
the
IRENE
scanning
machine
for
disc
records
,
which
images
with
microphotography
in
two
dimensions
,
invented
by
a
team
of
physicists
at
Lawrence
Berkeley
Laboratories
.
IRENE
will
retrieve
the
information
from
a
laterally
modulated
monaural
grooved
sound
source
without
touching
the
medium
itself
,
but
cannot
read
vertically
modulated
information
.
This
excludes
grooved
recordings
such
as
cylinders
and
some
radio
transcriptions
that
feature
a
hill
-
and
-
dale
format
of
recording
,
and
stereophonic
or
quadraphonic
grooved
recordings
,
which
utilize
a
combination
of
the
two
as
well
as
supersonic
encoding
for
quadraphonic
.
Terms
such
as
"
long-play
"
(
LP
)
and
"
extended
-
play
"
(
EP
)
describe
multi-track
records
that
play
much
longer
than
the
single-
item-
per-side
records
,
which
typically
do
not
go
much
past
four
minutes
per
side
.
An
LP
can
play
for
up
to
30
minutes
per
side
,
though
most
played
for
about
22
minutes
per
side
,
bringing
the
total
playing
time
of
a
typical
LP
recording
to
about
forty
-five
minutes
.
Many
pre-1952
LPs
,
however
,
played
for
about
15
minutes
per
side
.
The
7-
inch
45
rpm
format
normally
contains
one
item
per
side
but
a
7
-
inch
EP
could
achieve
recording
times
of
10
to
15
minutes
at
the
expense
of
attenuating
and
compressing
the
sound
to
reduce
the
width
required
by
the
groove
.
EP
discs
were
generally
used
to
make
available
tracks
not
on
singles
including
tracks
on
LPs
albums
in
a
smaller
,
less
expensive
format
for
those
who
had
only
45
rpm
players
.
The
large
center
hole
on
7
-
inch
45
rpm
records
allows
for
easier
handling
by
jukebox
mechanisms
.
The
term
"
album
"
,
originally
used
to
mean
a
"
book
"
with
liner
notes
,
holding
several
78
rpm
records
each
in
its
own
"
page
"
or
sleeve
,
no
longer
has
any
relation
to
the
physical
format
:
a
single
LP
record
,
or
nowadays
more
typically
a
compact
disc
.
In
March
1949
,
as
RCA
released
the
45
,
Columbia
released
several
hundred
7
inch
33
1/3
rpm
small
spindle
hole
singles
.
This
format
was
soon
dropped
as
it
became
clear
that
the
RCA
45
was
the
single
of
choice
and
the
Columbia
12
inch
LP
would
be
the
'
album
'
of
choice
.
The
first
release
of
the
45
came
in
seven
colors
:
black

favor
of
black
because
of
production
problems
.
However
,
yellow
and
deep
red
were
continued
until
about
1952
.
The
first
45
rpm
record
created
for
sale
was
"
PeeWee
the
Piccolo
"

47-

pressed
in
yellow
translucent
vinyl
at
the
Sherman
Avenue
plant
,
Indianapolis
Dec.

,
1948
,
R.O.

.
The
normal
commercial
disc
is
engraved
with
two
sound
-
bearing
concentric
spiral
grooves
,
one
on
each
side
,
running
from
the
outside
edge
towards
the
center
.
The
last
part
of
the
spiral
meets
an
earlier
part
to
form
a
circle
.
The
sound
is
encoded
by
fine
variations
in
the
edges
of
the
groove
that
cause
a
stylus
(
needle
)
placed
in
it
to
vibrate
at
acoustic
frequencies
when
the
disc
is
rotated
at
the
correct
speed
.
Generally
,
the
outer
and
inner
parts
of
the
groove
bear
no
intended
sound
(
an
exception
is
Split
Enz's
Mental
Notes
)
.
Towards
the
center
,
at
the
end
of
the
groove
,
there
is
another
wide
-
pitched
section
known
as
the
lead-out
.
At
the
very
end
of
this
section
the
groove
joins
itself
to
form
a
complete
circle
,
called
the
lock
groove
;
when
the
stylus
reaches
this
point
,
it
circles
repeatedly
until
lifted
from
the
record
.
On
some
recordings
(
for
example
Sgt.
Pepper
's
Lonely
Hearts
Club
Band
by
The
Beatles
,
Super
Trouper
by
Abba
and
Atom
Heart
Mother
by
Pink
Floyd
)
,
the
sound
continues
on
the
lock
groove
,
which
gives
a
strange
repeating
effect
.
Automatic
turntables
rely
on
the
position
or
angular
velocity
of
the
arm
,
as
it
reaches
the
wider
spacing
in
the
groove
,
to
trigger
a
mechanism
that
lifts
the
arm
off
the
record
.
Precisely
because
of
this
mechanism
,
most
automatic
turntables
are
incapable
of
playing
any
audio
in
the
lock
groove
,
since
they
will
lift
the
arm
before
it
reaches
that
groove
.
When
auto-changing
turntables
were
commonplace
,
records
were
typically
pressed
with
a
raised
(
or
ridged
)
outer
edge
and
a
raised
label
area
,
allowing
records
to
be
stacked
onto
each
other
without
the
delicate
grooves
coming
into
contact
,
reducing
the
risk
of
damage
.
Auto-changers
included
a
mechanism
to
support
a
stack
of
several
records
above
the
turntable
itself
,
dropping
them
one
at
a
time
onto
the
active
turntable
to
be
played
in
order
.
Many
longer
sound
recordings
,
such
as
complete
operas
,
were
interleaved
across
several
10
-
inch
or
12
-
inch
discs
for
use
with
auto-changing
mechanisms
,
so
that
the
first
disk
of
a
three
-
disk
recording
would
carry
sides
1
and
6
of
the
program
,
while
the
second
disk
would
carry
sides
2
and
5
,
and
the
third
,
sides
3
and
4
,
allowing
sides
1
,
2
,
and
3
to
be
played
automatically
;
then
the
whole
stack
reversed
to
play
sides
4
,
5
,
and
6
.
New

heavy
/
heavyweight
(
180
–
220
g
)
vinyl
is
commonly
used
for
modern
audiophile
vinyl
releases
in
all
genres
.
Many
collectors
prefer
to
have
heavyweight
vinyl
albums
,
which
have
been
reported
to
have
better
sound
than
normal
vinyl
because
of
their
higher
tolerance
against
deformation
caused
by
normal
play
.
180
g
vinyl
is
more
expensive
to
produce
only
because
it
uses
more
vinyl
.
Manufacturing
processes
are
identical
regardless
of
weight
.
In
fact
,
pressing
lightweight
records
requires
more
care
.
An
exception
is
the
propensity
of
200
g
pressings
to
be
slightly
more
prone
to
non-fill
,
when
the
vinyl
biscuit
does
not
sufficiently
fill
a
deep
groove
during
pressing
(
percussion
or
vocal
amplitude
changes
are
the
usual
locations
of
these
artifacts
)
.
This
flaw
causes
a
grinding
or
scratching
sound
at
the
non-fill
point
.
The
"
orange
peel
"
effect
on
vinyl
records
is
caused
by
worn
molds
.
Rather
than
having
the
proper
mirror-like
finish
,
the
surface
of
the
record
will
have
a
texture
that
looks
like
orange
peel
.
This
introduces
noise
into
the
record
,
particularly
in
the
lower
frequency
range
.
With
direct
metal
mastering
(
DMM
)
,
the
master
disc
is
cut
on
a
copper-coated
disc
,
which
can
also
have
a
minor
"
orange
peel
"
effect
on
the
disc
itself
.
As
this
"
orange
peel
"
originates
in
the
master
rather
than
being
introduced
in
the
pressing
stage
,
there
is
no
ill
effect
as
there
is
no
physical
distortion
of
the
groove
.
Original
master
discs
are
created
by
lathe-cutting
:
a
lathe
is
used
to
cut
a
modulated
groove
into
a
blank
record
.
The
blank
records
for
cutting
used
to
be
cooked
up
,
as
needed
,
by
the
cutting
engineer
,
using
what
Robert
K.
Morrison
describes
as
a
"
metallic
soap
,
"
containing
lead
litharge
,
ozokerite
,
barium
sulfate
,
montan
wax
,
stearin
and
paraffin
,
among
other
ingredients
.
Cut
"
wax
"
sound
discs
would
be
placed
in
a
vacuum
chamber
and
gold
-sputtered
to
make
them
electrically
conductive
for
use
as
mandrels
in
an
electroforming
bath
,
where
pressing
stamper
parts
were
made
.
Later
,
the
French
company
Pyral
invented
a
ready
-
made
blank
disc
having
a
thin
nitro-cellulose
lacquer
coating
(
approximately
7
mils
thickness
on
both
sides
)
that
was
applied
to
an
aluminum
substrate
.
Lacquer
cuts
result
in
an
immediately
playable
,
or
processable
,
master
record
.
If
vinyl
pressings
are
wanted
,
the
still
-unplayed
sound
disc
is
used
as
a
mandrel
for
electroforming
nickel
records
that
are
used
for
manufacturing
pressing
stampers
.
The
electroformed
nickel
records
are
mechanically
separated
from
their
respective
mandrels
.
This
is
done
with
relative
ease
because
no
actual
"
plating
"
of
the
mandrel
occurs
in
the
type
of
electrodeposition
known
as
electroforming
,
unlike
with
electroplating
,
in
which
the
adhesion
of
the
new
phase
of
metal
is
chemical
and
relatively
permanent
.
The
one-
molecule
-
thick
coating
of
silver
(
that
was
sprayed
onto
the
processed
lacquer
sound
disc
in
order
to
make
its
surface
electrically
conductive
)
reverse-plates
onto
the
nickel
record
's
face
.
This
negative
impression
disc
(
having
ridges
in
place
of
grooves
)
is
known
as
a
nickel
master
,
"
matrix
"
or
"
father
.
"
The
"
father
"
is
then
used
as
a
mandrel
to
electroform
a
positive
disc
known
as
a
"
mother
"
.
Many
mothers
can
be
grown
on
a
single
"
father
"
before
ridges
deteriorate
beyond
effective
use
.
The
"
mothers
"
are
then
used
as
mandrels
for
electroforming
more
negative
discs
known
as
"
sons
"
.
Each
"
mother
"
can
be
used
to
make
many
"
sons
"
before
deteriorating
.
The
"
sons
"
are
then
converted
into
"
stampers
"
by
center
-
punching
a
spindle
hole
(
which
was
lost
from
the
lacquer
sound
disc
during
initial
electroforming
of
the
"
father
"
)
,
and
by
custom-forming
the
target
pressing
profile
.
This
allows
them
to
be
placed
in
the
dies
of
the
target
(
make
and
model
)
record
press
and
,
by
center-roughing
,
to
facilitate
the
adhesion
of
the
label
,
which
gets
stuck
onto
the
vinyl
pressing
without
any
glue
.
In
this
way
,
several
million
vinyl
discs
can
be
produced
from
a
single
lacquer
sound
disc
.
When
only
a
few
hundred
discs
are
required
,
instead
of
electroforming
a
"
son
"
(
for
each
side
)
,
the
"
father
"
is
removed
of
its
silver
and
converted
into
a
stamper
.
Production
by
this
latter
method
,
known
as
the
"
two-step-
process
"
(
as
it
does
not
entail
creation
of
"
sons
"
but
does
involve
creation
of
"
mothers
,
"
which
are
used
for
test
playing
and
kept
as
"
safeties
"
for
electroforming
future
"
sons
"
)
is
limited
to
a
few
hundred
vinyl
pressings
.
The
pressing
count
can
increase
if
the
stamper
holds
out
and
the
quality
of
the
vinyl
is
high
.
The
"
sons
"
made
during
a
"
three-step
"
electroforming
make
better
stampers
since
they
do
n't
require
silver
removal
(
which
reduces
some
high
fidelity
because
of
etching
erasing
part
of
the
smallest
groove
modulations
)
and
also
because
they
have
a
stronger
metal
structure
than
"
fathers
"
.
Breakage
was
very
common
in
the
shellac
era
.
In
the
1934
John
O'Hara
novel
,
Appointment
in
Samarra
,
the
protagonist
"
broke
one
of
his
most
favorites
,
Whiteman
's
Lady
of
the
Evening
...
He
wanted
to
cry
but
could
not
.
"
A
poignant
moment
in
J.
D.
Salinger
's
1951
novel
The
Catcher
in
the
Rye
occurs
after
the
adolescent
protagonist
buys
a
record
for
his
younger
sister
but
drops
it
and
"
it
broke
into
pieces
...
I
damn-
near
cried
,
it
made
me
feel
so
terrible
.
"
A
sequence
where
a
school
teacher
's
collection
of
78
rpm
jazz
records
is
smashed
by
a
group
of
rebellious
students
is
a
key
moment
in
the
film
Blackboard
Jungle
.
Vinyl
records
do
not
break
easily
,
but
the
soft
material
is
easily
scratched
.
Vinyl
readily
acquires
a
static
charge
,
attracting
dust
that
is
difficult
to
remove
completely
.
Dust
and
scratches
cause
audio
clicks
and
pops
.
In
extreme
cases
,
they
can
cause
the
needle
to
skip
over
a
series
of
grooves
,
or
worse
yet
,
cause
the
needle
to
skip
backwards
,
creating
a
"
locked
groove
"
that
repeats
over
and
over
.
This
is
the
origin
of
the
phrase
"
like
a
broken
record
"
or
"
like
a
scratched
record
"
,
which
is
often
used
to
describe
a
person
or
thing
that
continually
repeats
itself
.
Locked
grooves
are
not
uncommon
and
were
even
heard
occasionally
in
radio
broadcasts
.
Vinyl
records
can
be
warped
by
heat
,
improper
storage
,
exposure
to
sunlight
,
or
manufacturing
defects
such
as
excessively
tight
plastic
shrinkwrap
on
the
album
cover
.
A
small
degree
of
warp
was
common
,
and
allowing
for
it
was
part
of
the
art
of
turntable
and
tonearm
design
.
"
wow
"
(
once-per-revolution
pitch
variation
)
could
result
from
warp
,
or
from
a
spindle
hole
that
was
not
precisely
centered
.
Standard
practice
for
LPs
was
to
place
the
LP
in
a
paper
or
plastic
inner
cover
.
This
,
if
placed
within
the
outer
cardboard
cover
so
that
the
opening
was
entirely
within
the
outer
cover
,
was
said
to
reduce
ingress
of
dust
onto
the
record
surface
.
Singles
,
with
rare
exceptions
,
had
simple
paper
covers
with
no
inner
cover
.
A
further
limitation
of
the
gramophone
record
is
that
fidelity
steadily
declines
as
playback
progresses
;
there
is
more
vinyl
per
second
available
for
fine
reproduction
of
high
frequencies
at
the
large-
diameter
beginning
of
the
groove
than
exist
at
the
smaller
-
diameters
close
to
the
end
of
the
side
.
At
the
start
of
a
groove
on
an
LP
there
are
510
mm
of
vinyl
per
second
traveling
past
the
stylus
while
the
ending
of
the
groove
gives
200
–
210
mm
of
vinyl
per
second
—
less
than
half
the
linear
resolution
.
Distortion
towards
the
end
of
the
side
is
likely
to
become
more
apparent
as
record
wear
increases
.
*
Tonearm
skating
forces
and
other
perturbations
are
also
picked
up
by
the
stylus
.
This
is
a
form
of
frequency
multiplexing
as
the
control
signal
(
restoring
force
)
used
to
keep
the
stylus
in
the
groove
is
carried
by
the
same
mechanism
as
the
sound
itself
.
Subsonic
frequencies
below
about
20
Hz
in
the
audio
signal
are
dominated
by
tracking
effects
,
which
is
one
form
of
unwanted
rumble
(
"
tracking
noise
"
)
and
merges
with
audible
frequencies
in
the
deep
bass
range
up
to
about
100
Hz
.
High
fidelity
sound
equipment
can
reproduce
tracking
noise
and
rumble
.
During
a
quiet
passage
,
woofer
speaker
cones
can
sometimes
be
seen
to
vibrate
with
the
subsonic
tracking
of
the
stylus
,
at
frequencies
as
low
as
just
above
0.5
Hz
(
the
frequency
at
which
a
33
1⁄3
rpm
record
turns
on
the
turntable
;
5⁄9
Hz
exactly
on
an
ideal
turntable
)
.
Another
reason
for
very
low
frequency
material
can
be
a
warped
disk
:
its
undulations
produce
frequencies
of
only
a
few
hertz
and
present
day
amplifiers
have
large
power
bandwidths
.
For
this
reason
,
many
stereo
receivers
contained
a
switchable
subsonic
filter
.
Some
subsonic
content
is
directly
out
of
phase
in
each
channel
.
If
played
back
on
a
mono
subwoofer
system
,
the
noise
will
cancel
,
significantly
reducing
the
amount
of
rumble
that
is
reproduced
.
Due
to
recording
mastering
and
manufacturing
limitations
,
both
high
and
low
frequencies
were
removed
from
the
first
recorded
signals
by
various
formulae
.
With
low
frequencies
,
the
stylus
must
swing
a
long
way
from
side
to
side
,
requiring
the
groove
to
be
wide
,
taking
up
more
space
and
limiting
the
playing
time
of
the
record
.
At
high
frequencies
,
hiss
,
pops
,
and
ticks
are
significant
.
These
problems
can
be
reduced
by
using
equalization
to
an
agreed
standard
.
During
recording
the
amplitude
of
low
frequencies
is
reduced
,
thus
reducing
the
groove
width
required
,
and
the
amplitude
at
high
frequencies
is
increased
.
The
playback
equipment
boosts
bass
and
cuts
treble
so
as
to
restore
the
tonal
balance
in
the
original
signal
;
this
also
reduces
the
high
frequency
noise
.
Thus
more
music
will
fit
on
the
record
,
and
noise
is
reduced
.
In
1926
Joseph
P.
Maxwell
and
Henry
C.
Harrison
from
Bell
Telephone
Laboratories
disclosed
that
the
recording
pattern
of
the
Western
Electric
"
rubber
line
"
magnetic
disc
cutter
had
a
constant
velocity
characteristic
.
This
meant
that
as
frequency
increased
in
the
treble
,
recording
amplitude
decreased
.
Conversely
,
in
the
bass
as
frequency
decreased
,
recording
amplitude
increased
.
Therefore
,
it
was
necessary
to
attenuate
the
bass
frequencies
below
about
250
Hz
,
the
bass
turnover
point
,
in
the
amplified
microphone
signal
fed
to
the
recording
head
.
Otherwise
,
bass
modulation
became
excessive
and
overcutting
took
place
into
the
next
record
groove
.
When
played
back
electrically
with
a
magnetic
pickup
having
a
smooth
response
in
the
bass
region
,
a
complementary
boost
in
amplitude
at
the
bass
turnover
point
was
necessary
.
G.
H.
Miller
in
1934
reported
that
when
complementary
boost
at
the
turnover
point
was
used
in
radio
broadcasts
of
records
,
the
reproduction
was
more
realistic
and
many
of
the
musical
instruments
stood
out
in
their
true
form
.
West
in
1930
and
later
P.
G.
A.
H.
Voigt
(
1940
)
showed
that
the
early
Wente-style
condenser
microphones
contributed
to
a
4
to
6
dB
midrange
brilliance
or
pre-emphasis
in
the
recording
chain
.
This
meant
that
the
electrical
recording
characteristics
of
Western
Electric
licensees
such
as
Columbia
Records
and
Victor
Talking
Machine
Company
in
the
1925
era
had
a
higher
amplitude
in
the
midrange
region
.
Brilliance
such
as
this
compensated
for
dullness
in
many
early
magnetic
pickups
having
drooping
midrange
and
treble
response
.
As
a
result
,
this
practice
was
the
empirical
beginning
of
using
pre-emphasis
above
1,000
Hz
in
78
rpm
and
33
1⁄3
rpm
records
.
Over
the
years
a
variety
of
record
equalization
practices
emerged
and
there
was
no
industry
standard
.
For
example
,
in
Europe
recordings
for
years
required
playback
with
a
bass
turnover
setting
of
250–300
Hz
and
a
treble
roll
-off
at
10,000
Hz
ranging
from
0
to
−5
dB
or
more
.
In
the
US
there
were
more
varied
practices
and
a
tendency
to
use
higher
bass
turnover
frequencies
such
as
500
Hz
as
well
as
a
greater
treble
rolloff
like
−
8.5
dB
and
even
more
to
record
generally
higher
modulation
levels
on
the
record
.
Evidence
from
the
early
technical
literature
concerning
electrical
recording
suggests
that
it
was
n't
until
the
1942
–
1949
period
that
there
were
serious
efforts
to
standardize
recording
characteristics
within
an
industry
.
Heretofore
,
electrical
recording
technology
from
company
to
company
was
considered
a
proprietary
art
all
the
way
back
to
the
1925
Western
Electric
licensed
method
used
by
Columbia
and
Victor
.
For
example
,
what
Brunswick
-
Balke
-Collender
(
Brunswick
Corporation
)
did
was
different
from
the
practices
of
Victor
.
Broadcasters
were
faced
with
having
to
adapt
daily
to
the
varied
recording
characteristics
of
many
sources
:
various
makers
of
"
home
recordings
"
readily
available
to
the
public
,
European
recordings
,
lateral
-
cut
transcriptions
,
and
vertical
-
cut
transcriptions
.
Efforts
were
started
in
1942
to
standardize
within
the
National
Association
of
Broadcasters
(
NAB
)
,
later
known
as
the
National
Association
of
Radio
and
Television
Broadcasters
(
NARTB
)
.
The
NAB
,
among
other
items
,
issued
recording
standards
in
1949
for
laterally
and
vertically
cut
records
,
principally
transcriptions
.
A
number
of
78
rpm
record
producers
as
well
as
early
LP
makers
also
cut
their
records
to
the
NAB
/
NARTB
lateral
standard
.
The
lateral
cut
NAB
curve
was
remarkably
similar
to
the
NBC
Orthacoustic
curve
that
evolved
from
practices
within
the
National
Broadcasting
Company
since
the
mid-1930s
.
Empirically
,
and
not
by
any
formula
,
it
was
learned
that
the
bass
end
of
the
audio
spectrum
below
100
Hz
could
be
boosted
somewhat
to
override
system
hum
and
turntable
rumble
noises
.
Likewise
at
the
treble
end
beginning
at
1,000
Hz
,
if
audio
frequencies
were
boosted
by
16
dB
at
10,000
Hz
the
delicate
sibilant
sounds
of
speech
and
high
overtones
of
musical
instruments
could
survive
the
noise
level
of
cellulose
acetate
,
lacquer
/
aluminum
,
and
vinyl
disc
media
.
When
the
record
was
played
back
using
a
complementary
inverse
curve
,
signal
-
to
-
noise
ratio
was
improved
and
the
programming
sounded
more
lifelike
.
Ultimately
,
the
New
Orthophonic
curve
was
disclosed
in
a
publication
by
R.C.
Moyer
of
RCA
Victor
in
1953
.
He
traced
RCA
Victor
characteristics
back
to
the
Western
Electric
"
rubber
line
"
recorder
in
1925
up
to
the
early
1950s
laying
claim
to
long-held
recording
practices
and
reasons
for
major
changes
in
the
intervening
years
.
The
RCA
Victor
New
Orthophonic
curve
was
within
the
tolerances
for
the
NAB
/
NARTB
,
Columbia
LP
,
and
AES
curves
.
It
eventually
became
the
technical
predecessor
to
the
RIAA
curve
.
Delicate
sounds
and
fine
overtones
were
mostly
lost
,
because
it
took
a
lot
of
sound
energy
to
vibrate
the
recording
horn
diaphragm
and
cutting
mechanism
.
There
were
acoustic
limitations
due
to
mechanical
resonances
in
both
the
recording
and
playback
system
.
Some
pictures
of
acoustic
recording
sessions
show
horns
wrapped
with
tape
to
help
mute
these
resonances
.
Even
an
acoustic
recording
played
back
electrically
on
modern
equipment
sounds
like
it
was
recorded
through
a
horn
,
notwithstanding
a
reduction
in
distortion
because
of
the
modern
playback
.
Toward
the
end
of
the
acoustic
era
,
there
were
many
fine
examples
of
recordings
made
with
horns
.
Electric
recording
which
developed
during
the
time
that
early
radio
was
becoming
popular
(
1925
)
benefited
from
the
microphones
and
amplifiers
used
in
radio
studios
.
The
early
electric
recordings
were
reminiscent
tonally
of
acoustic
recordings
,
except
there
was
more
recorded
bass
and
treble
as
well
as
delicate
sounds
and
overtones
cut
on
the
records
.
This
was
in
spite
of
some
carbon
microphones
used
,
which
had
resonances
that
colored
the
recorded
tone
.
The
double
button
carbon
microphone
with
stretched
diaphragm
was
a
marked
improvement
.
Alternatively
,
the
Wente
style
condenser
microphone
used
with
the
Western
Electric
licensed
recording
method
had
a
brilliant
midrange
and
was
prone
to
overloading
from
sibilants
in
speech
,
but
generally
it
gave
more
accurate
reproduction
than
carbon
microphones
.
It
was
not
unusual
for
electric
recordings
to
be
played
back
on
acoustic
phonographs
.
The
Victor
Orthophonic
phonograph
was
a
prime
example
where
such
playback
was
expected
.
In
the
Orthophonic
,
which
benefited
from
telephone
research
,
the
mechanical
pickup
head
was
redesigned
with
lower
resonance
than
the
traditional
mica
type
.
Also
,
a
folded
horn
with
an
exponential
taper
was
constructed
inside
the
cabinet
to
provide
better
impedance
matching
to
the
air
.
As
a
result
,
playback
of
an
Orthophonic
record
sounded
like
it
was
coming
from
a
radio
.
Eventually
,
when
it
was
more
common
for
electric
recordings
to
be
played
back
electrically
in
the
1930s
and
1940s
,
the
overall
tone
was
much
like
listening
to
a
radio
of
the
era
.
Magnetic
pickups
became
more
common
and
were
better
designed
as
time
went
on
,
making
it
possible
to
improve
the
damping
of
spurious
resonances
.
Crystal
pickups
were
also
introduced
as
lower
cost
alternatives
.
The
dynamic
or
moving
coil
microphone
was
introduced
around
1930
and
the
velocity
or
ribbon
microphone
in
1932
.
Both
of
these
high
quality
microphones
became
widespread
in
motion
picture
,
radio
,
recording
,
and
public
address
applications
.
Over
time
,
fidelity
,
dynamic
and
noise
levels
improved
to
the
point
that
it
was
harder
to
tell
the
difference
between
a
live
performance
in
the
studio
and
the
recorded
version
.
This
was
especially
true
after
the
invention
of
the
variable
reluctance
magnetic
pickup
cartridge
by
General
Electric
in
the
1940s
when
high
quality
cuts
were
played
on
well
-
designed
audio
systems
.
The
Capehart
radio
/
phonographs
of
the
era
with
large
diameter
electrodynamic
loudspeakers
,
though
not
ideal
,
demonstrated
this
quite
well
with
"
home
recordings
"
readily
available
in
the
music
stores
for
the
public
to
buy
.
There
were
important
quality
advances
in
recordings
specifically
made
for
radio
broadcast
.
In
the
early
1930s
Bell
Telephone
Laboratories
and
Western
Electric
announced
the
total
reinvention
of
disc
recording
:
the
Western
Electric
Wide
Range
System
,
"
The
New
Voice
of
Action
"
.
The
intent
of
the
new
Western
Electric
system
was
to
improve
the
overall
quality
of
disc
recording
and
playback
.
The
recording
speed
was
33
1⁄3
rpm
,
originally
used
in
the
Western
Electric
/
ERPI
movie
audio
disc
system
implemented
in
the
early
Warner
Brothers
'
Vitaphone
"
talkies
"
of
1927
.
The
newly
invented
Western
Electric
moving
coil
or
dynamic
microphone
was
part
of
the
Wide
Range
System
.
It
had
a
flatter
audio
response
than
the
old
style
Wente
condenser
type
and
did
n't
require
electronics
installed
in
the
microphone
housing
.
Signals
fed
to
the
cutting
head
were
pre-emphasized
in
the
treble
region
to
help
override
noise
in
playback
.
Groove
cuts
in
the
vertical
plane
were
employed
rather
than
the
usual
lateral
cuts
.
The
chief
advantage
claimed
was
more
grooves
per
inch
that
could
be
crowded
together
,
resulting
in
longer
playback
time
.
Additionally
,
the
problem
of
inner
groove
distortion
,
which
plagued
lateral
cuts
,
could
be
avoided
with
the
vertical
cut
system
.
Wax
masters
were
made
by
flowing
heated
wax
over
a
hot
metal
disc
thus
avoiding
the
microscopic
irregularities
of
cast
blocks
of
wax
and
the
necessity
of
planing
and
polishing
.
Vinyl
pressings
were
made
with
stampers
from
master
cuts
that
were
electroplated
in
vacuo
by
means
of
gold
sputtering
.
Audio
response
was
claimed
out
to
8,000
Hz
,
later
13,000
Hz
,
using
light
weight
pickups
employing
jeweled
styli
.
Amplifiers
and
cutters
both
using
negative
feedback
were
employed
thereby
improving
the
range
of
frequencies
cut
and
lowering
distortion
levels
.
Radio
transcription
producers
such
as
World
Broadcasting
System
and
Associated
Music
Publishers
(
AMP
)
were
the
dominant
licensees
of
the
Western
Electric
wide
range
system
and
towards
the
end
of
the
1930s
were
responsible
for
two
-thirds
of
the
total
radio
transcription
business
.
These
recordings
use
a
bass
turnover
of
300
Hz
and
a
10,000
Hz
rolloff
of
−
8.5
dB
.
The
complete
technical
disclosure
of
the
Columbia
LP
by
Peter
C.
Goldmark
,
Rene
'
Snepvangers
and
William
S.
Bachman
in
1949
made
it
possible
for
a
great
variety
of
record
companies
to
get
into
the
business
of
making
long
playing
records
.
The
business
grew
quickly
and
interest
spread
in
high
fidelity
sound
and
the
do-it-
yourself
market
for
pickups
,
turntables
,
amplifier
kits
,
loudspeaker
enclosure
plans
,
and
AM
/
FM
radio
tuners
.
The
LP
record
for
longer
works
,
45
rpm
for
pop
music
,
and
FM
radio
became
high
fidelity
program
sources
in
demand
.
Radio
listeners
heard
recordings
broadcast
and
this
in
turn
generated
more
record
sales
.
The
industry
flourished
.
There
is
a
theory
that
vinyl
records
can
audibly
represent
higher
frequencies
than
compact
discs
.
According
to
Red
Book
specifications
,
the
compact
disc
has
a
frequency
response
of
20
Hz
up
to
22,050
Hz
,
and
most
CD
players
measure
flat
within
a
fraction
of
a
decibel
from
at
least
20
Hz
to
20
kHz
at
full
output
.
Turntable
rumble
obscures
the
low-end
limit
of
vinyl
but
the
upper
end
can
be
,
with
some
cartridges
,
reasonably
flat
within
a
few
decibels
to
30
k
Hz
,
with
gentle
roll-off
.
Carrier
signals
of
Quad
LPs
popular
in
the
1970s
were
at
30
kHz
to
be
out
of
the
range
of
human
hearing
.
The
average
human
auditory
system
is
sensitive
to
frequencies
from
20
Hz
to
a
maximum
of
around
20,000
Hz
.
The
upper
and
lower
frequency
limits
of
human
hearing
vary
per
person
.
For
the
first
several
decades
of
disc
record
manufacturing
,
sound
was
recorded
directly
on
to
the
"
master
disc
"
at
the
recording
studio
.
From
about
1950
on
(
earlier
for
some
large
record
companies
,
later
for
some
small
ones
)
it
became
usual
to
have
the
performance
first
recorded
on
audio
tape
,
which
could
then
be
processed
and
/
or
edited
,
and
then
dubbed
on
to
the
master
disc
.
A
record
cutter
would
engrave
the
grooves
into
the
master
disc
.
Early
versions
of
these
master
discs
were
soft
wax
,
and
later
a
harder
lacquer
was
used
.
The
mastering
process
was
originally
something
of
an
art
as
the
operator
had
to
manually
allow
for
the
changes
in
sound
which
affected
how
wide
the
space
for
the
groove
needed
to
be
on
each
rotation
.
As
the
playing
of
gramophone
records
causes
gradual
degradation
of
the
recording
,
they
are
best
preserved
by
transferring
them
onto
other
media
and
playing
the
records
as
rarely
as
possible
.
They
need
to
be
stored
on
edge
,
and
do
best
under
environmental
conditions
that
most
humans
would
find
comfortable
.
The
medium
needs
to
be
kept
clean
,
but
alcohol
should
only
be
used
on
PVC
or
optical
media
,
not
on
78s.

The
equipment
for
playback
of
certain
formats
(
e.g.
,
16
and
78
rpm
)
is
manufactured
only
in
small
quantities
,
leading
to
increased
difficulty
in
finding
equipment
to
play
the
recordings
.
Where
old
disc
recordings
are
considered
to
be
of
artistic
or
historic
interest
,
from
before
the
era
of
tape
or
where
no
tape
master
exists
,
archivists
play
back
the
disc
on
suitable
equipment
and
record
the
result
,
typically
onto
a
digital
format
,
which
can
be
copied
and
manipulated
to
remove
analog
flaws
without
any
further
damage
to
the
source
recording
.
For
example
,
Nimbus
Records
uses
a
specially
built
horn
record
player
to
transfer
78s
.
Anyone
can
do
this
using
a
standard
record
player
with
a
suitable
pickup
,
a
phono-preamp
(
pre-amplifier
)
and
a
typical
personal
computer
.
However
,
for
accurate
transfer
,
professional
archivists
carefully
choose
the
correct
stylus
shape
and
diameter
,
tracking
weight
,
equalisation
curve
and
other
playback
parameters
and
use
high-quality
analogue
-
to-digital
converters
.
Groove
recordings
,
first
designed
in
the
final
quarter
of
the
19th
century
,
held
a
predominant
position
for
nearly
a
century
—
withstanding
competition
from
reel
-
to
-
reel
tape
,
the
8
-
track
cartridge
,
and
the
compact
cassette
.
In
1988
,
the
compact
disc
surpassed
the
gramophone
record
in
unit
sales
.
Vinyl
records
experienced
a
sudden
decline
in
popularity
between
1988
and
1991
,
when
the
major
label
distributors
restricted
their
return
policies
,
which
retailers
had
been
relying
on
to
maintain
and
swap
out
stocks
of
relatively
unpopular
titles
.
First
the
distributors
began
charging
retailers
more
for
new
product
if
they
returned
unsold
vinyl
,
and
then
they
stopped
providing
any
credit
at
all
for
returns
.
Retailers
,
fearing
they
would
be
stuck
with
anything
they
ordered
,
only
ordered
proven
,
popular
titles
that
they
knew
would
sell
,
and
devoted
more
shelf
space
to
CDs
and
cassettes
.
Record
companies
also
deleted
many
vinyl
titles
from
production
and
distribution
,
further
undermining
the
availability
of
the
format
and
leading
to
the
closure
of
pressing
plants
.
This
rapid
decline
in
the
availability
of
records
accelerated
the
format
's
decline
in
popularity
,
and
is
seen
by
some
as
a
deliberate
ploy
to
make
consumers
switch
to
CDs
,
which
were
more
profitable
for
the
record
companies
.
In
spite
of
their
flaws
,
such
as
the
lack
of
portability
,
records
still
have
enthusiastic
supporters
.
Vinyl
records
continue
to
be
manufactured
and
sold
today
,
especially
by
independent
rock
bands
and
labels
,
although
record
sales
are
considered
to
be
a
niche
market
composed
of
audiophiles
,
collectors
,
and
DJs
.
Old
records
and
out
-
of-
print
recordings
in
particular
are
in
much
demand
by
collectors
the
world
over
.
(
See
Record
collecting
.
)
Many
popular
new
albums
are
given
releases
on
vinyl
records
and
older
albums
are
also
given
reissues
,
sometimes
on
audiophile
-
grade
vinyl
.
Many
electronic
dance
music
and
hip
hop
releases
today
are
still
preferred
on
vinyl
;
however
,
digital
copies
are
still
widely
available
.
This
is
because
for
disc
jockeys
(
"
DJs
"
)
,
vinyl
has
an
advantage
over
the
CD
:
direct
manipulation
of
the
medium
.
DJ
techniques
such
as
slip-cueing
,
beatmatching
,
and
scratching
originated
on
turntables
.
With
CDs
or
compact
audio
cassettes
one
normally
has
only
indirect
manipulation
options
,
e.g.
,
the
play
,
stop
,
and
pause
buttons
.
With
a
record
one
can
place
the
stylus
a
few
grooves
farther
in
or
out
,
accelerate
or
decelerate
the
turntable
,
or
even
reverse
its
direction
,
provided
the
stylus
,
record
player
,
and
record
itself
are
built
to
withstand
it
.
However
,
many

capabilities
and
more
.
In

artist
Jack
White
sold
40,000
copies
of
his
second
solo
release
,
Lazaretto
,
on

.
The
sales
of
the
record
beat
the
largest
sales
in
one
week
on
vinyl
since
1991
.
The
sales
record
was
previously
held
by
Pearl

Vitalogy
,
which
sold
34,000
copies
in
one
week
in

In

,
the
sale
of
vinyl
records
was
the
only
physical

with
increasing

.
Sales
of
other

including

have
fallen

the

having

While
there
is
some
international
commonality
in
the
way
political
parties
are
recognized
,
and
in
how
they
operate
,
there
are
often
many
differences
,
and
some
are
significant
.
Many
political
parties
have
an
ideological
core
,
but
some
do
not
,
and
many
represent
very
different
ideologies
than
they
did
when
first
founded
.
In
democracies
,
political
parties
are
elected
by
the
electorate
to
run
a
government
.
Many
countries
have
numerous
powerful
political
parties
,
such
as
Germany
and
India
and
some
nations
have
one
-
party
systems
,
such
as
China
.
The
United
States
is
a
two
-party
system
,
with
its
two
most
powerful
parties
being
the
Democratic
Party
and
the
Republican
Party
.
The
first
political
factions
,
cohering
around
a
basic
,
if
fluid
,
set
of
principles
emerged
from
the
Exclusion
Crisis
and
Glorious
Revolution
in
late
-
17th
-century
England
.
The
Whigs
supported
Protestant
constitutional
monarchy
against
absolute
rule
and
the
Tories
,
originating
in
the
Royalist
(
or
"
Cavalier
"
)
faction
of
the
English
Civil
War
,
were
conservative
royalist
supporters
of
a
strong
monarchy
as
a
counterbalance
to
the
republican
tendencies
of
Whigs
,
who
were
the
dominant
political
faction
for
most
of
the
first
half
of
the
18th
century
;
they
supported
the
Hanoverian
succession
of
1715
against
the
Jacobite
supporters
of
the
deposed
Roman
Catholic
Stuart
dynasty
and
were
able
to
purge
Tory
politicians
from
important
government
positions
after
the
failed
Jacobite
rising
of
1715
.
The
leader
of
the
Whigs
was
Robert
Walpole
,
who
maintained
control
of
the
government
in
the
period
1721
–
1742
;
his
protégé
was
Henry
Pelham
(
1743
–
1754
)
.
As
the
century
wore
on
,
the
factions
slowly
began
to
adopt
more
coherent
political
tendencies
as
the
interests
of
their
power
bases
began
to
diverge
.
The
Whig
party
's
initial
base
of
support
from
the
great
aristocratic
families
,
widened
to
include
the
emerging
industrial
interests
and
wealthy
merchants
.
As
well
as
championing
constitutional
monarchy
with
strict
limits
on
the
monarch
's
power
,
the
Whigs
adamantly
opposed
a
Catholic
king
as
a
threat
to
liberty
,
and
believed
in
extending
toleration
to
nonconformist
Protestants
,
or
dissenters
.
A
major
influence
on
the
Whigs
were
the
liberal
political
ideas
of
John
Locke
,
and
the
concepts
of
universal
rights
employed
by
Locke
and
Algernon
Sidney
.
Although
the
Tories
were
dismissed
from
office
for
half
a
century
,
for
most
of
this
period
(
at
first
under
the
leadership
of
Sir
William
Wyndham
)
,
the
Tories
retained
party
cohesion
,
with
occasional
hopes
of
regaining
office
,
particularly
at
the
accession
of
George
II
(
1727
)
and
the
downfall
of
the
ministry
of
Sir
Robert
Walpole
in
1742
.
They
acted
as
a
united
,
though
unavailing
,
opposition
to
Whig
corruption
and
scandals
.
At
times
they
cooperated
with
the
"
Opposition
Whigs
"
,
Whigs
who
were
in
opposition
to
the
Whig
government
;
however
,
the
ideological
gap
between
the
Tories
and
the
Opposition
Whigs
prevented
them
from
coalescing
as
a
single
party
.
They
finally
regained
power
with
the
accession
of
George
III
in
1760
under
Lord
Bute
.
When
they
lost
power
,
the
old
Whig
leadership
dissolved
into
a
decade
of
factional
chaos
with
distinct
"
Grenvillite
"
,
"
Bedfordite
"
,
"
Rockinghamite
"
,
and
"
Chathamite
"
factions
successively
in
power
,
and
all
referring
to
themselves
as
"
Whigs
"
.
Out
of
this
chaos
,
the
first
distinctive
parties
emerged
.
The
first
such
party
was
the
Rockingham
Whigs
under
the
leadership
of
Charles
Watson
-Wentworth
and
the
intellectual
guidance
of
the
political
philosopher
Edmund
Burke
.
Burke
laid
out
a
philosophy
that
described
the
basic
framework
of
the
political
party
as
"
a
body
of
men
united
for
promoting
by
their
joint
endeavours
the
national
interest
,
upon
some
particular
principle
in
which
they
are
all
agreed
"
.
As
opposed
to
the
instability
of
the
earlier
factions
,
which
were
often
tied
to
a
particular
leader
and
could
disintegrate
if
removed
from
power
,
the
party
was
centred
around
a
set
of
core
principles
and
remained
out
of
power
as
a
united
opposition
to
government
.
The
modern
Conservative
Party
was
created
out
of
the
'
Pittite
'
Tories
of
the
early
19th
century
.
In
the
late
1820s
disputes
over
political
reform
broke
up
this
grouping
.
A
government
led
by
the
Duke
of
Wellington
collapsed
amidst
dire
election
results
.
Following
this
disaster
Robert
Peel
set
about
assembling
a
new
coalition
of
forces
.
Peel
issued
the
Tamworth
Manifesto
in
1834
which
set
out
the
basic
principles
of
Conservatism
;
–
the
necessity
in
specific
cases
of
reform
in
order
to
survive
,
but
an
opposition
to
unnecessary
change
,
that
could
lead
to
"
a
perpetual
vortex
of
agitation
"
.
Meanwhile
,
the
Whigs
,
along
with
free
trade
Tory
followers
of
Robert
Peel
,
and
independent
Radicals
,
formed
the
Liberal
Party
under
Lord
Palmerston
in
1859
,
and
transformed
into
a
party
of
the
growing
urban
middle
-class
,
under
the
long
leadership
of
William
Ewart
Gladstone
.
Although
the
Founding
Fathers
of
the
United
States
did
not
originally
intend
for
American
politics
to
be
partisan
,
early
political
controversies
in
the
1790s
over
the
extent
of
federal
government
powers
saw
the
emergence
of
two
proto-political
parties
-
the
Federalist
Party
and
the
Democratic-Republican
Party
,
which
were
championed
by
Framers
Alexander
Hamilton
and
James
Madison
,
respectively
.
However
,
a
consensus
reached
on
these
issues
ended
party
politics
in
1816
for
a
decade
,
a
period
commonly
known
as
the
Era
of
Good
Feelings
.
At
the
same
time
,
the
political
party
reached
its
modern
form
,
with
a
membership
disciplined
through
the
use
of
a
party
whip
and
the
implementation
of
efficient
structures
of
control
.
The
Home
Rule
League
Party
,
campaigning
for
Home
Rule
for
Ireland
in
the
British
Parliament
was
fundamentally
changed
by
the
great
Irish
political
leader
Charles
Stewart
Parnell
in
the
1880s
.
In
1882
,
he
changed
his
party
's
name
to
the
Irish
Parliamentary
Party
and
created
a
well
-
organized
grass
roots
structure
,
introducing
membership
to
replace
"
ad
hoc
"
informal
groupings
.
He
created
a
new
selection
procedure
to
ensure
the
professional
selection
of
party
candidates
committed
to
taking
their
seats
,
and
in
1884
he
imposed
a
firm
'
party
pledge
'
which
obliged
MPs
to
vote
as
a
bloc
in
parliament
on
all
occasions
.
The
creation
of
a
strict
party
whip
and
a
formal
party
structure
was
unique
at
the
time
.
His
party
's
efficient
structure
and
control
contrasted
with
the
loose
rules
and
flexible
informality
found
in
the
main
British
parties
;
–
they
soon
came
to
model
themselves
on
the
Parnellite
model
.
A
political
party
is
typically
led
by
a
party
leader
(
the
most
powerful
member
and
spokesperson
representing
the
party
)
,
a
party
secretary
(
who
maintains
the
daily
work
and
records
of
party
meetings
)
,
party
treasurer
(
who
is
responsible
for
membership
dues
)
and
party
chair
(
who
forms
strategies
for
recruiting
and
retaining
party
members
,
and
also
chairs
party
meetings
)
.
Most
of
the
above
positions
are
also
members
of
the
party
executive
,
the
leading
organization
which
sets
policy
for
the
entire
party
at
the
national
level
.
The
structure
is
far
more
decentralized
in
the
United
States
because
of
the
separation
of
powers
,
federalism
and
the
multiplicity
of
economic
interests
and
religious
sects
.
Even
state
parties
are
decentralized
as
county
and
other
local
committees
are
largely
independent
of
state
central
committees
.
The
national
party
leader
in
the
U.S.
will
be
the
president
,
if
the
party
holds
that
office
,
or
a
prominent
member
of
Congress
in
opposition
(
although
a
big-state
governor
may
aspire
to
that
role
)
.
Officially
,
each
party
has
a
chairman
for
its
national
committee
who
is
a
prominent
spokesman
,
organizer
and
fund-raiser
,
but
without
the
status
of
prominent
elected
office
holders
.
When
the
party
is
represented
by
members
in
the
lower
house
of
parliament
,
the
party
leader
simultaneously
serves
as
the
leader
of
the
parliamentary
group
of
that
full
party
representation
;
depending
on
a
minimum
number
of
seats
held
,
Westminster
-
based
parties
typically
allow
for
leaders
to
form
frontbench
teams
of
senior
fellow
members
of
the
parliamentary
group
to
serve
as
critics
of
aspects
of
government
policy
.
When
a
party
becomes
the
largest
party
not
part
of
the
Government
,
the
party
's
parliamentary
group
forms
the
Official
Opposition
,
with
Official
Opposition
frontbench
team
members
often
forming
the
Official
Opposition
Shadow
cabinet
.
When
a
party
achieves
enough
seats
in
an
election
to
form
a
majority
,
the
party
's
frontbench
becomes
the
Cabinet
of
government
ministers
.
The
freedom
to
form
,
declare
membership
in
,
or
campaign
for
candidates
from
a
political
party
is
considered
a
measurement
of
a
state
's
adherence
to
liberal
democracy
as
a
political
value
.
Regulation
of
parties
may
run
from
a
crackdown
on
or
repression
of
all
opposition
parties
,
a
norm
for
authoritarian
governments
,
to
the
repression
of
certain
parties
which
hold
or
promote
ideals
which
run
counter
to
the
general
ideology
of
the
state
's
incumbents
(
or
possess
membership
by
-
laws
which
are
legally
unenforceable
)
.
Furthermore
,
in
the
case
of
far-right
,
far-left
and
regionalism
parties
in
the
national
parliaments
of
much
of
the
European
Union
,
mainstream
political
parties
may
form
an
informal
cordon
sanitarian
which
applies
a
policy
of
non-cooperation
towards
those
"
Outsider
Parties
"
present
in
the
legislature
which
are
viewed
as
'
anti-system
'
or
otherwise
unacceptable
for
government
.
Cordon
Sanitarian
,
however
,
have
been
increasingly
abandoned
over
the
past
two
decades
in
multi-party
democracies
as
the
pressure
to
construct
broad
coalitions
in
order
to
win
elections
–
along
with
the
increased
willingness
of
outsider
parties
themselves
to
participate
in
government
–
has
led
to
many
such
parties
entering
electoral
and
government
coalitions
.
In
a
nonpartisan
system
,
no
official
political
parties
exist
,
sometimes
reflecting
legal
restrictions
on
political
parties
.
In
nonpartisan
elections
,
each
candidate
is
eligible
for
office
on
his
or
her
own
merits
.
In
nonpartisan
legislatures
,
there
are
no
typically
formal
party
alignments
within
the
legislature
.
The
administration
of
George
Washington
and
the
first
few
sessions
of
the
United
States
Congress
were
nonpartisan
.
Washington
also
warned
against
political
parties
during
his
Farewell
Address
.
In
the
United
States
,
the
unicameral
legislature
of
Nebraska
is
nonpartisan
but
is
elected
and
votes
on
informal
party
lines
.
In
Canada
,
the
territorial
legislatures
of
the
Northwest
Territories
and
Nunavut
are
nonpartisan
.
In
New
Zealand
,
Tokelau
has
a
nonpartisan
parliament
.
Many
city
and
county
governments
[
vague
]
are
nonpartisan
.
Nonpartisan
elections
and
modes
of
governance
are
common
outside
of
state
institutions
.
Unless
there
are
legal
prohibitions
against
political
parties
,
factions
within
nonpartisan
systems
often
evolve
into
political
parties
.
In
one
-
party
systems
,
one
political
party
is
legally
allowed
to
hold
effective
power
.
Although
minor
parties
may
sometimes
be
allowed
,
they
are
legally
required
to
accept
the
leadership
of
the
dominant
party
.
This
party
may
not
always
be
identical
to
the
government
,
although
sometimes
positions
within
the
party
may
in
fact
be
more
important
than
positions
within
the
government
.
North
Korea
and
China
are
examples
;
others
can
be
found
in
Fascist
states
,
such
as
Nazi
Germany
between
1934
and
1945
.
The
one-
party
system
is
thus
usually
equated
with
dictatorships
and
tyranny
.
In
dominant
-
party
systems
,
opposition
parties
are
allowed
,
and
there
may
be
even
a
deeply
established
democratic
tradition
,
but
other
parties
are
widely
considered
to
have
no
real
chance
of
gaining
power
.
Sometimes
,
political
,
social
and
economic
circumstances
,
and
public
opinion
are
the
reason
for
others
parties
'
failure
.
Sometimes
,
typically
in
countries
with
less
of
an
established
democratic
tradition
,
it
is
possible
the
dominant
party
will
remain
in
power
by
using
patronage
and
sometimes
by
voting
fraud
.
In
the
latter
case
,
the
definition
between
dominant
and
one-
party
system
becomes
rather
blurred
.
Examples
of
dominant
party
systems
include
the
People
's
Action
Party
in
Singapore
,
the
African
National
Congress
in
South
Africa
,
the
Cambodian
People
's
Party
in
Cambodia
,
the
Liberal
Democratic
Party
in
Japan
,
and
the
National
Liberation
Front
in
Algeria
.
One
-party
dominant
system
also
existed
in
Mexico
with
the
Institutional
Revolutionary
Party
until
the
1990s
,
in
the
southern
United
States
with
the
Democratic
Party
from
the
late
19th
century
until
the
1970s
,
in
Indonesia
with
the
Golkar
from
the
early
1970s
until
1998
.
The
United
States
has
become
essentially
a
two
-party
system
.
Since
a
conservative
(
such
as
the
Republican
Party
)
and
liberal
(
such
as
the
Democratic
Party
)
party
has
usually
been
the
status
quo
within
American
politics
.
The
first
parties
were
called
Federalist
and
Republican
,
followed
by
a
brief
period
of
Republican
dominance
before
a
split
occurred
between
National
Republicans
and
Democratic
Republicans
.
The
former
became
the
Whig
Party
and
the
latter
became
the
Democratic
Party
.
The
Whigs
survived
only
for
two
decades
before
they
split
over
the
spread
of
slavery
,
those
opposed
becoming
members
of
the
new
Republican
Party
,
as
did
anti-slavery
members
of
the
Democratic
Party
.
Third
parties
(
such
as
the
Libertarian
Party
)
often
receive
little
support
and
are
very
rarely
the
victors
in
elections
.
Despite
this
,
there
have
been
several
examples
of
third
parties
siphoning
votes
from
major
parties
that
were
expected
to
win
(
such
as
Theodore
Roosevelt
in
the
election
of
1912
and
George
Wallace
in
the
election
of
1968
)
.
As
third
party
movements
have
learned
,
the
Electoral
College
's
requirement
of
a
nationally
distributed
majority
makes
it
difficult
for
third
parties
to
succeed
.
Thus
,
such
parties
rarely
win
many
electoral
votes
,
although
their
popular
support
within
a
state
may
tip
it
toward
one
party
or
the
other
.
Wallace
had
weak
support
outside
the
South
.
More
generally
,
parties
with
a
broad
base
of
support
across
regions
or
among
economic
and
other
interest
groups
,
have
a
great
chance
of
winning
the
necessary
plurality
in
the
U.S.
's
largely
single
-member
district
,
winner
-
take
-
all
elections
.
The
tremendous
land
area
and
large
population
of
the
country
are
formidable
challenges
to
political
parties
with
a
narrow
appeal
.
The

political
system
,
while
technically
a
multi-party
system
,
has
functioned
generally
as
a
two
-party
(
sometimes
called
a
"
two
-
and
-
a-
half
party
"
)
system
;
since
the
1920s
the
two
largest
political
parties
have
been
the
Conservative
Party
and
the
Labour
Party
.
Before
the
Labour
Party
rose
in
British
politics
the
Liberal
Party
was
the
other
major
political
party
along
with
the
Conservatives
.
Though
coalition
and
minority
governments
have
been
an
occasional
feature
of
parliamentary
politics
,
the
first
-
past
-
the
-
post
electoral
system
used
for
general
elections
tends
to
maintain
the
dominance
of
these
two
parties
,
though
each
has
in
the
past
century
relied
upon
a
third
party
to
deliver
a
working
majority
in
Parliament
.
(
A
plurality
voting
system
usually
leads
to
a
two
-party
system
,
a
relationship
described
by
Maurice
Duverger
and
known
as
Duverger
's
Law
.
)
There
are
also
numerous
other
parties
that
hold
or
have
held
a
number
of
seats
in
Parliament
.
More
commonly
,
in
cases
where
there
are
three
or
more
parties
,
no
one
party
is
likely
to
gain
power
alone
,
and
parties
work
with
each
other
to
form
coalition
governments
.
This
has
been
an
emerging
trend
in
the
politics
of
the
Republic
of
Ireland
since
the
1980s
and
is
almost
always
the
case
in
Germany
on
national
and
state
level
,
and
in
most
constituencies
at
the
communal
level
.
Furthermore
,
since
the
forming
of
the
Republic
of
Iceland
there
has
never
been
a
government
not
led
by
a
coalition
(
usually
of
the
Independence
Party
and
one
other
(
often
the
Social
Democratic
Alliance
)
.
A
similar
situation
exists
in
the
Republic
of
Ireland
;
since
1989
,
no
one
party
has
held
power
on
its
own
.
Since
then
,
numerous
coalition
governments
have
been
formed
.
These
coalitions
have
been
exclusively
led
by
one
of
either
Fianna
Fáil
or
Fine
Gael
.
Political
change
is
often
easier
with
a
coalition
government
than
in
one-
party
or
two
-party
dominant
systems
.

If
factions
in
a
two
-party
system
are
in
fundamental
disagreement
on
policy
goals
,
or
even
principles
,
they
can
be
slow
to
make
policy
changes
,
which
appears
to
be
the
case
now
in
the
U.S.
with
power
split
between
Democrats
and
Republicans
.
Still
coalition
governments
struggle
,
sometimes
for
years
,
to
change
policy
and
often
fail
altogether
,
post
World
War
II
France
and
Italy
being
prime
examples
.
When
one
party
in
a
two
-party
system
controls
all
elective
branches
,
however
,
policy
changes
can
be
both
swift
and
significant
.
Democrats
Woodrow
Wilson
,
Franklin
Roosevelt
and
Lyndon
Johnson
were
beneficiaries
of
such
fortuitous
circumstances
,
as
were
Republicans
as
far
removed
in
time
as
Abraham
Lincoln
and
Ronald
Reagan
.
Barack
Obama
briefly
had
such
an
advantage
between
2009
and
2011
.
Political
parties
,
still
called
factions
by
some
,
especially
those
in
the
governmental
apparatus
,
are
lobbied
vigorously
by
organizations
,
businesses
and
special
interest
groups
such
as
trade
unions
.
Money
and
gifts
-
in-
kind
to
a
party
,
or
its
leading
members
,
may
be
offered
as
incentives
.
Such
donations
are
the
traditional
source
of
funding
for
all
right
-
of-
centre
cadre
parties
.
Starting
in
the
late
19th
century
these
parties
were
opposed
by
the
newly
founded
left-of-
centre
workers
'
parties
.
They
started
a
new
party
type
,
the
mass
membership
party
,
and
a
new
source
of
political
fundraising
,
membership
dues
.
From
the
second
half
of
the
20th
century
on
parties
which
continued
to
rely
on
donations
or
membership
subscriptions
ran
into
mounting
problems
.
Along
with
the
increased
scrutiny
of
donations
there
has
been
a
long-term
decline
in
party
memberships
in
most
western
democracies
which
itself
places
more
strains
on
funding
.
For
example
,
in
the
United
Kingdom
and
Australia
membership
of
the
two
main
parties
in
2006
is
less
than
an
1/8
of
what
it
was
in
1950
,
despite
significant
increases
in
population
over
that
period
.
In
the
United
Kingdom
,
it
has
been
alleged
that
peerages
have
been
awarded
to
contributors
to
party
funds
,
the
benefactors
becoming
members
of
the
House
of
Lords
and
thus
being
in
a
position
to
participate
in
legislating
.
Famously
,
Lloyd
George
was
found
to
have
been
selling
peerages
.
To
prevent
such
corruption
in
the
future
,
Parliament
passed
the
Honours
(
Prevention
of
Abuses
)
Act
1925
into
law
.
Thus
the
outright
sale
of
peerages
and
similar
honours
became
a
criminal
act
.
However
,
some
benefactors
are
alleged
to
have
attempted
to
circumvent
this
by
cloaking
their
contributions
as
loans
,
giving
rise
to
the
'
Cash
for
Peerages
'
scandal
.
There
are
two
broad
categories
of
public
funding
,
direct
,
which
entails
a
monetary
transfer
to
a
party
,
and
indirect
,
which
includes
broadcasting
time
on
state
media
,
use
of
the
mail
service
or
supplies
.
According
to
the
Comparative
Data
from
the
ACE
Electoral
Knowledge
Network
,
out
of
a
sample
of
over
180
nations
,
25
%
of
nations
provide
no
direct
or
indirect
public
funding
,
58
%
provide
direct
public
funding
and
60
%
of
nations
provide
indirect
public
funding
.
Some
countries
provide
both
direct
and
indirect
public
funding
to
political
parties
.
Funding
may
be
equal
for
all
parties
or
depend
on
the
results
of
previous
elections
or
the
number
of
candidates
participating
in
an
election
.
Frequently
parties
rely
on
a
mix
of
private
and
public
funding
and
are
required
to
disclose
their
finances
to
the
Election
management
body
.
In
fledgling
democracies
funding
can
also
be
provided
by
foreign
aid
.
International
donors
provide
financing
to
political
parties
in
developing
countries
as
a
means
to
promote
democracy
and
good
governance
.
Support
can
be
purely
financial
or
otherwise
.
Frequently
it
is
provided
as
capacity
development
activities
including
the
development
of
party
manifestos
,
party
constitutions
and
campaigning
skills
.
Developing
links
between
ideologically
linked
parties
is
another
common
feature
of
international
support
for
a
party
.
Sometimes
this
can
be
perceived
as
directly
supporting
the
political
aims
of
a
political
party
,
such
as
the
support
of
the
US
government
to
the
Georgian
party
behind
the
Rose
Revolution
.
Other
donors
work
on
a
more
neutral
basis
,
where
multiple
donors
provide
grants
in
countries
accessible
by
all
parties
for
various
aims
defined
by
the
recipients
.
There
have
been
calls
by
leading
development
think
-
tanks
,
such
as
the
Overseas
Development
Institute
,
to
increase
support
to
political
parties
as
part
of
developing
the
capacity
to
deal
with
the
demands
of
interest-driven
donors
to
improve
governance
.
Green
is
the
color
for
green
parties
,
Islamist
parties
,
Nordic
agrarian
parties
and
Irish
republican
parties
.
Orange
is
sometimes
a
color
of
nationalism
,
such
as
in
the
Netherlands
,
in
Israel
with
the
Orange
Camp
or
with
Ulster
Loyalists
in
Northern
Ireland
;
it
is
also
a
color
of
reform
such
as
in
Ukraine
.
In
the
past
,
Purple
was
considered
the
color
of
royalty
(
like
white
)
,
but
today
it
is
sometimes
used
for
feminist
parties
.
White
also
is
associated
with
nationalism
.
"
Purple
Party
"
is
also
used
as
an
academic
hypothetical
of
an
undefined
party
,
as
a
Centrist
party
in
the
United
States
(
because
purple
is
created
from
mixing
the
main
parties
'
colors
of
red
and
blue
)
and
as
a
highly
idealistic
"
peace
and
love
"
party
—
in
a
similar
vein
to
a
Green
Party
,
perhaps
.
Black
is
generally
associated
with
fascist
parties
,
going
back
to
Benito
Mussolini
's
blackshirts
,
but
also
with
Anarchism
.
Similarly
,
brown
is
sometimes
associated
with
Nazism
,
going
back
to
the
Nazi
Party
's
tan-uniformed
storm
troopers
.
Political
color
schemes
in
the
United
States
diverge
from
international
norms
.
Since
2000
,
red
has
become
associated
with
the
right-wing
Republican
Party
and
blue
with
the
left-wing
Democratic
Party
.
However
,
unlike
political
color
schemes
of
other
countries
,
the
parties
did
not
choose
those
colors
;
they
were
used
in
news
coverage
of
2000
election
results
and
ensuing
legal
battle
and
caught
on
in
popular
usage
.
Prior
to
the
2000
election
the
media
typically
alternated
which
color
represented
which
party
each
presidential
election
cycle
.
The
color
scheme
happened
to
get
inordinate
attention
that
year
,
so
the
cycle
was
stopped
lest
it
cause
confusion
the
following
election
.
During
the
19th
and
20th
century
,
many
national
political
parties
organized
themselves
into
international
organizations
along
similar
policy
lines
.
Notable
examples
are
The
Universal
Party
,
International
Workingmen
's
Association
(
also
called
the
First
International
)
,
the
Socialist
International
(
also
called
the
Second
International
)
,
the
Communist
International
(
also
called
the
Third
International
)
,
and
the
Fourth
International
,
as
organizations
of
working
class
parties
,
or
the
Liberal
International
(
yellow
)
,
Hizb
ut
-
Tahrir
,
Christian
Democratic
International
and
the
International
Democrat
Union
(

)
.
Organized
in
Italy
in
1945
,
the
International
Communist
Party
,
since
1974
headquartered
in
Florence
has
sections
in
six
countries
.

,
The

the

,
and

Some
administrations
(
e.g.
Hong

)
outlaw
formal
linkages
between
local

effectively
outlawing
international
political
parties
.
French
political
scientist
Maurice
Duverger
drew
a
distinction
between
cadre
parties
and
mass
parties
.
Cadre
parties
were
political
elites
that
were
concerned
with
contesting
elections
and
restricted
the
influence
of
outsiders
,
who
were
only
required
to
assist
in
election
campaigns
.
Mass
parties
tried
to
recruit
new
members
who
were
a
source
of
party
income
and
were
often
expected
to
spread
party
ideology
as
well
as
assist
in
elections
.
Socialist
parties
are
examples
of
mass
parties
,
while
the
British
Conservative
Party
and
the
German
Christian
Democratic
Union
are
examples
of
hybrid
parties
.
In
the
United
States
,
where
both
major
parties
were
cadre
parties
,
the
introduction
of
primaries
and
other
reforms
has
transformed
them
so
that
power
is
held
by
activists
who
compete
over
influence
and
nomination
of
candidates
.
The
Order
of
Preachers
(
Latin
:
Ordo
Praedicatorum
,
hence
the
abbreviation
OP
used
by
members
)
,
more
commonly
known
after
the
15th
century
as
the
Dominican
Order
or
Dominicans
,
is
a
Roman
Catholic
religious
order
founded
by
the
Spanish
priest
Saint
Dominic
de
Guzman
in
France
and
approved
by
Pope
Honorius
III
(
1216
–
27
)
on
22
December
1216
.
Membership
in
this
"
mendicant
"
order
includes
friars
,
nuns
,
active
sisters
,
and
lay
or
secular
Dominicans
(
formerly
known
as
tertiaries
,
though
recently
there
has
been
a
growing
number
of
Associates
,
who
are
unrelated
to
the
tertiaries
)
affiliated
with
the
order
.
Founded
to
preach
the
Gospel
and
to
combat
heresy
,
the
teaching
activity
of
the
order
and
its
scholastic
organization
placed
the
Preachers
in
the
forefront
of
the
intellectual
life
of
the
Middle
Ages
.
The
order
is
famed
for
its
intellectual
tradition
,
having
produced
many
leading
theologians
and
philosophers
.
The
Dominican
Order
is
headed
by
the
Master
of
the
Order
,
who
is
currently
Bruno
Cadoré
.
Members
of
the
order
generally
carry
the
letters
O.P.
,
standing
for
Ordinis
Praedicatorum
,
meaning
of
the
Order
of
Preachers
,
after
their
names
.
The
Dominican
Order
came
into
being
in
the
Middle
Ages
at
a
time
when
religion
began
to
be
contemplated
in
a
new
way
.
Men
of
God
were
no
longer
expected
to
stay
behind
the
walls
of
a
cloister
.
Instead
,
they
travelled
among
the
people
,
taking
as
their
examples
the
apostles
of
the
primitive
Church
.
Out
of
this
ideal
emerged
two
orders
of
mendicant
friars
:
one
,
the
Friars
Minor
,
was
led
by
Francis
of
Assisi
;
the
other
,
the
Friars
Preachers
,
by
Dominic
of
Guzman
.
Like
his
contemporary
,
Francis
,
Dominic
saw
the
need
for
a
new
type
of
organization
,
and
the
quick
growth
of
the
Dominicans
and
Franciscans
during
their
first
century
of
existence
confirms
that
the
orders
of
mendicant
friars
met
a
need
.
Dominic
sought
to
establish
a
new
kind
of
order
,
one
that
would
bring
the
dedication
and
systematic
education
of
the
older
monastic
orders
like
the
Benedictines
to
bear
on
the
religious
problems
of
the
burgeoning
population
of
cities
,
but
with
more
organizational
flexibility
than
either
monastic
orders
or
the
secular
clergy
.
Dominic
's
new
order
was
to
be
a
preaching
order
,
trained
to
preach
in
the
vernacular
languages
.
Rather
than
earning
their
living
on
vast
farms
as
the
monasteries
had
done
,
the
new
friars
would
survive
by
begging
,
"
selling
"
themselves
through
persuasive
preaching
.
Dominic
inspired
his
followers
with
loyalty
to
learning
and
virtue
,
a
deep
recognition
of
the
spiritual
power
of
worldly
deprivation
and
the
religious
state
,
and
a
highly
developed
governmental
structure
.
At
the
same
time
,
Dominic
inspired
the
members
of
his
order
to
develop
a
"
mixed
"
spirituality
.
They
were
both
active
in
preaching
,
and
contemplative
in
study
,
prayer
and
meditation
.
The
brethren
of
the
Dominican
Order
were
urban
and
learned
,
as
well
as
contemplative
and
mystical
in
their
spirituality
.
While
these
traits
had
an
impact
on
the
women
of
the
order
,
the
nuns
especially
absorbed
the
latter
characteristics
and
made
those
characteristics
their
own
.
In
England
,
the
Dominican
nuns
blended
these
elements
with
the
defining
characteristics
of
English
Dominican
spirituality
and
created
a
spirituality
and
collective
personality
that
set
them
apart
.
As
an
adolescent
,
he
had
a
particular
love
of
theology
and
the
Scriptures
became
the
foundation
of
his
spirituality
.
During
his
studies
in
Palencia
,
Spain
,
he
experienced
a
dreadful
famine
,
prompting
Dominic
to
sell
all
of
his
beloved
books
and
other
equipment
to
help
his
neighbors
.
After
he
completed
his
studies
,
Bishop
Martin
Bazan
and
Prior
Diego
d'Achebes
appointed
Dominic
to
the
cathedral
chapter
and
he
became
a
regular
canon
under
the
Rule
of
St.
Augustine
and
the
Constitutions
for
the
cathedral
church
of
Osma
.
At
the
age
of
twenty
-
four
or
twenty
-
five
,
he
was
ordained
to
the
priesthood
.
In
1203
,
Dominic
joined
Prior
Diego
de
Acebo
on
an
embassy
to
Denmark
for
the
monarchy
of
Spain
,
to
arrange
the
marriage
between
the
son
of
King
Alfonso
VIII
of
Castile
and
a
niece
of
King
Valdemar
II
of
Denmark
.
At
that
time
the
south
of
France
was
the
stronghold
of
the
Cathar
or
Albigensian
heresy
,
named
after
the
Duke
of
Albi
,
a
Cathar
sympathiser
and
opponent
to
the
subsequent
Albigensian
Crusade
(
1209
–
1229
)
.
Dominic
was
fired
by
a
reforming
zeal
after
they
encountered
Albigensian
Christians
at
Toulouse
.
Prior
Diego
saw
immediately
one
of
the
paramount
reasons
for
the
spread
of
the
unorthodox
movement
:
the
representatives
of
the
Holy
Church
acted
and
moved
with
an
offensive
amount
of
pomp
and
ceremony
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
Cathars
lived
in
a
state
of
self-
sacrifice
that
was
widely
appealing
.
For
these
reasons
,
Prior
Diego
suggested
that
the
papal
legates
begin
to
live
a
reformed
apostolic
life
.
The
legates
agreed
to
change
if
they
could
find
a
strong
leader
.
The
prior
took
up
the
challenge
,
and
he
and
Dominic
dedicated
themselves
to
the
conversion
of
the
Albigensians
.
Despite
this
particular
mission
,
in
winning
the
Albigensians
over
by
persuasion
Dominic
met
limited
success
,
"
for
though
in
his
ten
years
of
preaching
a
large
number
of
converts
were
made
,
it
has
to
be
said
that
the
results
were
not
such
as
had
been
hoped
for
.
"
Dominic
became
the
spiritual
father
to
several
Albigensian
women
he
had
reconciled
to
the
faith
,
and
in
1206
he
established
them
in
a
convent
in
Prouille
.
This
convent
would
become
the
foundation
of
the
Dominican
nuns
,
thus
making
the
Dominican
nuns
older
than
the
Dominican
friars
.
Prior
Diego
sanctioned
the
building
of
a
monastery
for
girls
whose
parents
had
sent
them
to
the
care
of
the
Albigensians
because
their
families
were
too
poor
to
fulfill
their
basic
needs
.
The
monastery
was
at
Prouille
would
later
become
Dominic
's
headquarters
for
his
missionary
effort
there
.
After
two
years
on
the
mission
field
,
Prior
Diego
died
while
traveling
back
to
Spain
.
When
his
preaching
companions
heard
of
his
death
,
all
save
Dominic
and
a
very
small
number
of
others
returned
to
their
homes
.
In
July
1215
,
with
the
approbation
of
Bishop
Foulques
of
Toulouse
,
Dominic
ordered
his
followers
into
an
institutional
life
.
Its
purpose
was
revolutionary
in
the
pastoral
ministry
of
the
Catholic
Church
.
These
priests
were
organized
and
well
trained
in
religious
studies
.
Dominic
needed
a
framework
—
a
rule
—
to
organize
these
components
.
The
Rule
of
St.
Augustine
was
an
obvious
choice
for
the
Dominican
Order
,
according
to
Dominic
's
successor
,
Jordan
of
Saxony
,
because
it
lent
itself
to
the
"
salvation
of
souls
through
preaching
"
.
By
this
choice
,
however
,
the
Dominican
brothers
designated
themselves
not
monks
,
but
canons-regular
.
They
could
practice
ministry
and
common
life
while
existing
in
individual
poverty
.
Dominic
's
education
at
Palencia
gave
him
the
knowledge
he
needed
to
overcome
the
Manicheans
.
With
charity
,
the
other
concept
that
most
defines
the
work
and
spirituality
of
the
order
,
study
became
the
method
most
used
by
the
Dominicans
in
working
to
defend
the
Church
against
the
perils
that
hounded
it
,
and
also
of
enlarging
its
authority
over
larger
areas
of
the
known
world
.
In
Dominic
's
thinking
,
it
was
impossible
for
men
to
preach
what
they
did
not
or
could
not
understand
.
When
the
brethren
left
Prouille
,
then
,
to
begin
their
apostolic
work
,
Dominic
sent
Matthew
of
Paris
to
establish
a
school
near
the
University
of
Paris
.
This
was
the
first
of
many
Dominican
schools
established
by
the
brethren
,
some
near
large
universities
throughout
Europe
.
In
1219
Pope
Honorius
III
invited
Saint
Dominic
and
his
companions
to
take
up
residence
at
the
ancient
Roman
basilica
of
Santa
Sabina
,
which
they
did
by
early
1220
.
Before
that
time
the
friars
had
only
a
temporary
residence
in
Rome
at
the
convent
of
San
Sisto
Vecchio
which
Honorius
III
had
given
to
Dominic
circa
1218
intending
it
to
become
a
convent
for
a
reformation
of
nuns
at
Rome
under
Dominic
's
guidance
.
In
May
1220
at
Bologna
the
order
's
first
General
Chapter
mandated
that
each
new
priory
of
the
order
maintain
its
own
studium
conventuale
thus
laying
the
foundation
of
the
Dominican
tradition
of
sponsoring
widespread
institutions
of
learning
.
The
official
foundation
of
the
Dominican
convent
at
Santa
Sabina
with
its
studium
conventuale
occurred
with
the
legal
transfer
of
property
from
Honorius
III
to
the
Order
of
Preachers
on
June
5
,
1222
.
This
studium
was
transformed
into
the
order
's
first
studium
provinciale
by
Saint
Thomas
Aquinas
in
1265
.
Part
of
the
curriculum
of
this
studium
was
relocated
in
1288
at
the
studium
of
Santa
Maria
sopra
Minerva
which
in
the
16th
century
world
be
transformed
into
the
College
of
Saint
Thomas
(
Latin
:
Collegium
Divi
Thomæ
)
.
In
the
20th
century
the
college
would
be
relocated
to
the
convent
of
Saints
Dominic
and
Sixtus
and
would
be
transformed
into
the
Pontifical
University
of
Saint
Thomas
Aquinas
,
Angelicum
.
The
Dominican
friars
quickly
spread
,
including
to
England
,
where
they
appeared
in
Oxford
in
1221
.
In
the
13th
century
the
order
reached
all
classes
of
Christian
society
,
fought
heresy
,
schism
,
and
paganism
by
word
and
book
,
and
by
its
missions
to
the
north
of
Europe
,
to
Africa
,
and
Asia
passed
beyond
the
frontiers
of
Christendom
.
Its
schools
spread
throughout
the
entire
Church
;
its
doctors
wrote
monumental
works
in
all
branches
of
knowledge
,
including
the
extremely
important
Albertus
Magnus
and
Thomas
Aquinas
.
Its
members
included
popes
,
cardinals
,
bishops
,
legates
,
inquisitors
,
confessors
of
princes
,
ambassadors
,
and
paciarii
(
enforcers
of
the
peace
decreed
by
popes
or
councils
)
.
The
order
was
appointed
by
Pope
Gregory
IX
the
duty
to
carry
out
the
Inquisition
.
In
his
Papal
Bull
Ad
extirpanda
of
1252
,
Pope
Innocent
IV
authorised
the
Dominicans
'
use
of
torture
under
prescribed
circumstances
.
The
expansion
of
the
order
produced
changes
.
A
smaller
emphasis
on
doctrinal
activity
favoured
the
development
here
and
there
of
the
ascetic
and
contemplative
life
and
there
sprang
up
,
especially
in
Germany
and
Italy
,
the
mystical
movement
with
which
the
names
of
Meister
Eckhart
,
Heinrich
Suso
,
Johannes
Tauler
,
and
St.
Catherine
of
Siena
are
associated
.
(
See
German
mysticism
,
which
has
also
been
called
"
Dominican
mysticism
.
"
)
This
movement
was
the
prelude
to
the
reforms
undertaken
,
at
the
end
of
the
century
,
by
Raymond
of
Capua
,
and
continued
in
the
following
century
.
It
assumed
remarkable
proportions
in
the
congregations
of
Lombardy
and
the
Netherlands
,
and
in
the
reforms
of
Savonarola
in
Florence
.
At
the
same
time
the
order
found
itself
face
to
face
with
the
Renaissance
.
It
struggled
against
pagan
tendencies
in
Renaissance
humanism
,
in
Italy
through
Dominici
and
Savonarola
,
in
Germany
through
the
theologians
of
Cologne
but
it
also
furnished
humanism
with
such
advanced
writers
as
Francesco
Colonna
(
probably
the
writer
of
the
Hypnerotomachia
Poliphili
)
and
Matteo
Bandello
.
Many
Dominicans
took
part
in
the
artistic
activity
of
the
age
,
the
most
prominent
being
Fra
Angelico
and
Fra
Bartolomeo
.
During
this
critical
period
,
the
number
of
Preachers
seems
never
to
have
sunk
below
3,500
.
Statistics
for
1876
show
3,748
,
but
500
of
these
had
been
expelled
from
their
convents
and
were
engaged
in
parochial
work
.
Statistics
for
1910
show
a
total
of
4,472
nominally
or
actually
engaged
in
proper
activities
of
the
order
.
In
the
year
2000
,
there
were
5,171
Dominican
friars
in
solemn
vows
,
917
student
brothers
,
and
237
novices
.
By
the
year
2013
there
were
6058
Dominican
friars
,
including
4,470
priests
.
In
the
revival
movement
France
held
a
foremost
place
,
owing
to
the
reputation
and
convincing
power
of
the
orator
,
Jean-Baptiste
Henri
Lacordaire
(
1802
–
1861
)
.
He
took
the
habit
of
a
Friar
Preacher
at
Rome
(
1839
)
,
and
the
province
of
France
was
canonically
erected
in
1850
.
From
this
province
were
detached
the
province
of
Lyon
,
called
Occitania
(
1862
)
,
that
of
Toulouse
(
1869
)
,
and
that
of
Canada
(
1909
)
.
The
French
restoration
likewise
furnished
many
laborers
to
other
provinces
,
to
assist
in
their
organization
and
progress
.
From
it
came
the
master
general
who
remained
longest
at
the
head
of
the
administration
during
the
19th
century
,
Père
Vincent
Jandel
(
1850
–
1872
)
.
Here
should
be
mentioned
the
province
of
St.
Joseph
in
the
United
States
.
Founded
in
1805
by
Edward
Fenwick
,
afterwards
first
Bishop
of
Cincinnati
,
Ohio
(
1821
–
1832
)
,
this
province
has
developed
slowly
,
but
now
ranks
among
the
most
flourishing
and
active
provinces
of
the
order
.
In
1910
it
numbered
seventeen
convents
or
secondary
houses
.
In
1905
,
it
established
a
large
house
of
studies
at
Washington
,
D.C.
,
called
the
Dominican
House
of
Studies
.
There
are
now
four
Dominican
provinces
in
the
United
States
.
The
province
of
France
has
produced
a
large
number
of
preachers
.
The
conferences
of
Notre-Dame-de-Paris
were
inaugurated
by
Père
Lacordaire
.
The
Dominicans
of
the
province
of
France
furnished
Lacordaire
(
1835
–
1836
,
1843
–
1851
)

Jacques
Monsabré

Today
,
there
is
a
growing
number
of
Associates
who
share
the
Dominican
charism
.
Dominican
Associates
are
Christian
women
and
men
;
married
,
single
,
divorced
,
and
widowed
;
clergy
members
and
lay
persons
who
were
first
drawn
to
and
then
called
to
live
out
the
charism
and
continue
the
mission
of
the
Dominican
Order
-
to
praise
,
to
bless
,
to
preach
.
Associates
do
not
take
vows
,
but
rather
make
a
commitment
to
be
partners
with
vowed
members
,
and
to
share
the
mission
and
charism
of
the
Dominican
Family
in
their
own
lives
,
families
,
churches
,
neighborhoods
,
workplaces
,
and
cities
.
The
spiritual
tradition
of
Dominic
's
Order
is
punctuated
not
only
by
charity
,
study
and
preaching
,
but
also
by
instances
of
mystical
union
.
The
Dominican
emphasis
on
learning
and
on
charity
distinguishes
it
from
other
monastic
and
mendicant
orders
.
As
the
order
first
developed
on
the
European
continent
,
learning
continued
to
be
emphasized
by
these
friars
and
their
sisters
in
Christ
.
These
religious
also
struggled
for
a
deeply
personal
,
intimate
relationship
with
God
.
When
the
order
reached
England
,
many
of
these
attributes
were
kept
,
but
the
English
gave
the
order
additional
,
specialized
characteristics
.
This
topic
is
discussed
below
.
Dominic
's
search
for
a
close
relationship
with
God
was
determined
and
unceasing
.
He
rarely
spoke
,
so
little
of
his
interior
life
is
known
.
What
is
known
about
it
comes
from
accounts
written
by
people
near
to
him
.
St.
Cecilia
remembered
him
as
cheerful
,
charitable
and
full
of
unceasing
vigor
.
From
a
number
of
accounts
,
singing
was
apparently
one
of
Dominic
's
great
delights
.
Dominic
practiced
self-scourging
and
would
mortify
himself
as
he
prayed
alone
in
the
chapel
at
night
for
'
poor
sinners
.
'
He
owned
a
single
habit
,
refused
to
carry
money
,
and
would
allow
no
one
to
serve
him
.
The
spirituality
evidenced
throughout
all
of
the
branches
of
the
order
reflects
the
spirit
and
intentions
of
its
founder
,
though
some
of
the
elements
of
what
later
developed
might
have
surprised
the
Castilian
friar
.
Fundamentally
,
Dominic
was
"
...
a
man
of
prayer
who
utilized
the
full
resources
of
the
learning
available
to
him
to
preach
,
to
teach
,
and
even
materially
to
assist
those
searching
for
the
truth
found
in
the
gospel
of
Christ
.
It
is
that
spirit
which
[
Dominic
]
bequeathed
to
his
followers
"
.
Humbert
of
Romans
,
the
master
general
of
the
order
from
1254
to
1263
,
was
a
great
administrator
,
as
well
as
preacher
and
writer
.
It
was
under
his
tenure
as
master
general
that
the
sisters
in
the
order
were
given
official
membership
.
Humbert
was
a
great
lover
of
languages
,
and
encouraged
linguistic
studies
among
the
Dominicans
,
primarily
Arabic
,
because
of
the
missionary
work
friars
were
pursuing
amongst
those
led
astray
or
forced
to
convert
by
Muslims
in
the
Middle
East
.
He
also
wanted
his
friars
to
reach
excellence
in
their
preaching
,
and
this
was
his
most
lasting
contribution
to
the
order
.
The
growth
of
the
spirituality
of
young
preachers
was
his
first
priority
.
He
once
cried
to
his
students
:
"
...
consider
how
excellent
this
office
[
of
preaching
]
is
,
because
it
is
apostolic
;
how
useful
,
because
it
is
directly
ordained
for
the
salvation
of
souls
;
how
perilous
,
because
few
have
in
them
,
or
perform
,
what
the
office
requires
,
for
it
is
not
without
great
danger

(
Lyon

1677
)
Humbert
is
at
the
center
of
ascetic
writers
in
the
Dominican
Order
.
In
this
role
,
he
added
significantly
to
its
spirituality
.
His
writings
are
permeated
with
"
religious
good
sense
,
"
and
he
used
uncomplicated
language
that
could
edify
even
the
weakest
member
.
Humbert
advised
his
readers
,
"
[
Young
Dominicans
]
are
also
to
be
instructed
not
to
be
eager
to
see
visions
or
work
miracles
,
since
these
avail
little
to
salvation
,
and
sometimes
we
are
fooled
by
them
;
but
rather
they
should
be
eager
to
do
good
in
which
salvation
consists
.
Also
,
they
should
be
taught
not
to
be
sad
if
they
do
not
enjoy
the
divine
consolations
they
hear
others
have
;
but
they
should
know
the
loving
Father
for
some
reason
sometimes
withholds
these
.
Again
,
they
should
learn
that
if
they
lack
the
grace
of
compunction
or
devotion
they
should
not
think
they
are
not
in
the
state
of
grace
as
long
as
they
have
good
will
,
which
is
all
that
God
regards
"
.
Another
who
contributed
significantly
to
the
spirituality
of
the
order
is
Albertus
Magnus
,
the
only
person
of
the
period
to
be
given
the
appellation
"
Great
"
.
His
influence
on
the
brotherhood
permeated
nearly
every
aspect
of
Dominican
life
.
Albert
was
a
scientist
,
philosopher
,
astrologer
,
theologian
,
spiritual
writer
,
ecumenist
,
and
diplomat
.
Under
the
auspices
of
Humbert
of
Romans
,
Albert
molded
the
curriculum
of
studies
for
all
Dominican
students
,
introduced
Aristotle
to
the
classroom
and
probed
the
work
of
Neoplatonists
,
such
as
Plotinus
.
Indeed
,
it
was
the
thirty
years
of
work
done
by
Thomas
Aquinas
and
himself
(
1245
–
1274
)
that
allowed
for
the
inclusion
of
Aristotelian
study
in
the
curriculum
of
Dominican
schools
.
One
of
Albert
's
greatest
contributions
was
his
study
of
Dionysus
the
Areopagite
,
a
mystical
theologian
whose
words
left
an
indelible
imprint
in
the
medieval
period
.
Magnus
'
writings
made
a
significant
contribution
to
German
mysticism
,
which
became
vibrant
in
the
minds
of
the
Beguines
and
women
such
as
Hildegard
of
Bingen
and
Mechthild
of
Magdeburg
.
Mysticism
,
for
the
purposes
of
this
study
,
refers
to
the
conviction
that
all
believers
have
the
capability
to
experience
God
's
love
.
This
love
may
manifest
itself
through
brief
ecstatic
experiences
,
such
that
one
may
be
engulfed
by
God
and
gain
an
immediate
knowledge
of
Him
,
which
is
unknowable
through
the
intellect
alone
.
Albertus
Magnus
championed
the
idea
,
drawn
from
Dionysus
,
that
positive
knowledge
of
God
is
possible
,
but
obscure
.
Thus
,
it
is
easier
to
state
what
God
is
not
,
than
to
state
what
God
is
:
"
...
we
affirm
things
of
God
only
relatively
,
that
is
,
casually
,
whereas
we
deny
things
of
God
absolutely
,
that
is
,
with
reference
to
what
He
is
in
Himself
.
And
there
is
no
contradiction
between
a
relative
affirmation
and
an
absolute
negation
.
It
is
not
contradictory
to
say
that
someone
is
white
-
toothed
and
not
white
"
.
Albert
the
Great
wrote
that
wisdom
and
understanding
enhance
one
's
faith
in
God
.
According
to
him
,
these
are
the
tools
that
God
uses
to
commune
with
a
contemplative
.
Love
in
the
soul
is
both
the
cause
and
result
of
true
understanding
and
judgement
.
It
causes
not
only
an
intellectual
knowledge
of
God
,
but
a
spiritual
and
emotional
knowledge
as
well
.
Contemplation
is
the
means
whereby
one
can
obtain
this
goal
of
understanding
.
Things
that
once
seemed
static
and
unchanging
become
full
of
possibility
and
perfection
.
The
contemplative
then
knows
that
God
is
,
but
she
does
not
know
what
God
is
.
Thus
,
contemplation
forever
produces
a
mystified
,
imperfect
knowledge
of
God
.
The
soul
is
exalted
beyond
the
rest
of
God
's
creation
but
it
cannot
see
God
Himself
.
As
the
image
of
God
grows
within
man
,
he
learns
to
rely
less
on
an
intellectual
pursuit
of
virtue
and
more
on
an
affective
pursuit
of
charity
and
meekness
.
Meekness
and
charity
guide
Christians
to
acknowledge
that
they
are
nothing
without
the
One
(
God
/
Christ
)
who
created
them
,
sustains
them
,
and
guides
them
.
Thus
,
man
then
directs
his
path
to
that
One
,
and
the
love
for
,
and
of
,
Christ
guides
man's
very
nature
to
become
centered
on
the
One
,
and
on
his
neighbor
as
well
.
Charity
is
the
manifestation
of
the
pure
love
of
Christ
,
both
for
and
by
His
follower
.
The
Dominican
Order
was
affected
by
a
number
of
elemental
influences
.
Its
early
members
imbued
the
order
with
a
mysticism
and
learning
.
The
Europeans
of
the
order
embraced
ecstatic
mysticism
on
a
grand
scale
and
looked
to
a
union
with
the
Creator
.
The
English
Dominicans
looked
for
this
complete
unity
as
well
,
but
were
not
so
focused
on
ecstatic
experiences
.
Instead
,
their
goal
was
to
emulate
the
moral
life
of
Christ
more
completely
.
The
Dartford
nuns
were
surrounded
by
all
of
these
legacies
,
and
used
them
to
create
something
unique
.
Though
they
are
not
called
mystics
,
they
are
known
for
their
piety
toward
God
and
their
determination
to
live
lives
devoted
to
,
and
in
emulation
of
,
Him
.
Although
Albertus
Magnus
did
much
to
instill
mysticism
in
the
Order
of
Preachers
,
it
is
a
concept
that
reaches
back
to
the
Hebrew
Bible
.
In
the
tradition
of
Holy
Writ
,
the
impossibility
of
coming
face
to
face
with
God
is
a
recurring
motif
,
thus
the
commandment
against
graven
images
(
Exodus
20.4
-
5
)
.
As
time
passed
,
Jewish
and
early
Christian
writings
presented
the
idea
of
'
unknowing
,
'
where
God
's
presence
was
enveloped
in
a
dark
cloud
.
These
images
arose
out
of
a
confusing
mass
of
ambiguous
and
ambivalent
statements
regarding
the
nature
of
God
and
man
's
relationship
to
Him
.
Although
Dominic
and
the
early
brethren
had
instituted
female
Dominican
houses
at
Prouille
and
other
places
by
1227
,
some
of
the
brethren
of
the
order
had
misgivings
about
the
necessity
of
female
religious
establishments
in
an
order
whose
major
purpose
was
preaching
,
a
duty
in
which
women
could
not
traditionally
engage
.
In
spite
of
these
doubts
,
women
's
houses
dotted
the
countryside
throughout
Europe
.
There
were
seventy
-
four
Dominican
female
houses
in
Germany
,
forty
-
two
in
Italy
,
nine
in
France
,
eight
in
Spain
,
six
in
Bohemia
,
three
in
Hungary
,
and
three
in
Poland
.
Many
of
the
German
religious
houses
that
lodged
women
had
been
home
to
communities
of
women
,
such
as
Beguines
,
that
became
Dominican
once
they
were
taught
by
the
traveling
preachers
and
put
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
Dominican
authoritative
structure
.
A
number
of
these
houses
became
centers
of
study
and
mystical
spirituality
in
the
14th
century
.
There
were
one
hundred
and
fifty
-seven
nunneries
in
the
order
by
1358
.
In
that
year
,
the
number
lessened
due
to
disasters
like
the
Black
Death
.
Female
houses
differed
from
male
Dominican
houses
in
a
lack
of
apostolic
work
for
the
women
.
Instead
,
the
sisters
chanted
the
Divine
Office
and
kept
all
the
monastic
observances
.
Their
lives
were
often
much
more
strict
than
their
brothers
'
lives
.
The
sisters
had
no
government
of
their
own
,
but
lived
under
the
authority
of
the
general
and
provincial
chapters
of
the
order
.
They
were
compelled
to
obey
all
the
rules
and
shared
in
all
the
applicable
privileges
of
the
order
.
Like
the
Priory
of
Dartford
,
all
Dominican
nunneries
were
under
the
jurisdiction
of
friars
.
The
friars
served
as
their
confessors
,
priests
,
teachers
and
spiritual
mentors
.
Women
could
not
be
professed
to
the
Dominican
religious
life
before
the
age
of
thirteen
.
The
formula
for
profession
contained
in
the
Constitutions
of
Montargis
Priory
(
1250
)
demands
that
nuns
pledge
obedience
to
God
,
the
Blessed
Virgin
,
their
prioress
and
her
successors
according
to
the
Rule
of
St.
Augustine
and
the
institute
of
the
order
,
until
death
.
The
clothing
of
the
sisters
consisted
of
a
white
tunic
and
scapular
,
a
leather
belt
,
a
black
mantle
,
and
a
black
veil
.
Candidates
to
profession
were
tested
to
reveal
whether
they
were
actually
married
women
who
had
merely
separated
from
their
husbands
.
Their
intellectual
abilities
were
also
tested
.
Nuns
were
to
be
silent
in
places
of
prayer
,
the
cloister
,
the
dormitory
,
and
refectory
.
Silence
was
maintained
unless
the
prioress
granted
an
exception
for
a
specific
cause
.
Speaking
was
allowed
in
the
common
parlor
,
but
it
was
subordinate
to
strict
rules
,
and
the
prioress
,
subprioress
or
other
senior
nun
had
to
be
present
.
Because
the
nuns
of
the
order
did
not
preach
among
the
people
,
the
need
to
engage
in
study
was
not
as
immediate
or
intense
as
it
was
for
men
.
They
did
participate
,
however
,
in
a
number
of
intellectual
activities
.
Along
with
sewing
and
embroidery
,
nuns
often
engaged
in
reading
and
discussing
correspondence
from
Church
leaders
.
In
the
Strassburg
monastery
of
St.
Margaret
,
some
of
the
nuns
could
converse
fluently
in
Latin
.
Learning
still
had
an
elevated
place
in
the
lives
of
these
religious
.
In
fact
,
Margarette
Reglerin
,
a
daughter
of
a
wealthy
Nuremberg
family
,
was
dismissed
from
a
convent
because
she
did
not
have
the
ability
or
will
to
learn
.
As
heirs
of
the
Dominican
priory
of
Poissy
in
France
,
the
Dartford
sisters
were
also
heirs
to
a
tradition
of
profound
learning
and
piety
.
Sections
of
translations
of
spiritual
writings
in
Dartford
's
library
,
such
as
Suso
's
Little
Book
of
Eternal
Wisdom
and
Laurent
du
Bois
'
Somme
le
Roi
,
show
that
the
"
ghoostli
"
link
to
Europe
was
not
lost
in
the
crossing
of
the
Channel
.
It
survived
in
the
minds
of
the
nuns
.
Also
,
the
nuns
shared
a
unique
identity
with
Poissy
as
a
religious
house
founded
by
a
royal
house
.
The
English
nuns
were
proud
of
this
heritage
,
and
aware
that
many
of
them
shared
in
England
's
great
history
as
members
of
the
noble
class
,
as
seen
in
the
next
chapter
.
The
English
Province
was
a
component
of
the
international
order
from
which
it
obtained
its
laws
,
direction
,
and
instructions
.
It
was
also
,
however
,
a
group
of
Englishmen
.
Its
direct
supervisors
were
from
England
,
and
the
members
of
the
English
Province
dwelt
and
labored
in
English
cities
,
towns
,
villages
,
and
roadways
.
English
and
European
ingredients
constantly
came
in
contact
.
The
international
side
of
the
province
's
existence
influenced
the
national
,
and
the
national
responded
to
,
adapted
,
and
sometimes
constrained
the
international
.
The
first
Dominican
site
in
England
was
at
Oxford
,
in
the
parishes
of
St.
Edward
and
St.
Adelaide
.
The
friars
built
an
oratory
to
the
Blessed
Virgin
Mary
and
by
1265
,
the
brethren
,
in
keeping
with
their
devotion
to
study
,
began
erecting
a
school
.
Actually
,
the
Dominican
brothers
likely
began
a
school
immediately
after
their
arrival
,
as
priories
were
legally
schools
.
Information
about
the
schools
of
the
English
Province
is
limited
,
but
a
few
facts
are
known
.
Much
of
the
information
available
is
taken
from
visitation
records
.
The
"
visitation
"
was
a
section
of
the
province
through
which
visitors
to
each
priory
could
describe
the
state
of
its
religious
life
and
its
studies
to
the
next
chapter
.
There
were
four
such
visits
in
England
and
Wales
—
Oxford
,
London
,
Cambridge
and
York
.
All
Dominican
students
were
required
to
learn
grammar
,
old
and
new
logic
,
natural
philosophy
and
theology
.
Of
all
of
the
curricular
areas
,
however
,
theology
was
the
most
important
.
This
is
not
surprising
when
one
remembers
Dominic
's
zeal
for
it
.
English
Dominican
mysticism
in
the
late
medieval
period
differed
from
European
strands
of
it
in
that
,
whereas
European
Dominican
mysticism
tended
to
concentrate
on
ecstatic
experiences
of
union
with
the
divine
,
English
Dominican
mysticism
's
ultimate
focus
was
on
a
crucial
dynamic
in
one
's
personal
relationship
with
God
.
This
was
an
essential
moral
imitation
of
the
Savior
as
an
ideal
for
religious
change
,
and
as
the
means
for
reformation
of
humanity
's
nature
as
an
image
of
divinity
.
This
type
of
mysticism
carried
with
it
four
elements
.
First
,
spiritually
it
emulated
the
moral
essence
of
Christ
's
life
.
Second
,
there
was
a
connection
linking
moral
emulation
of
Christ
's
life
and
humanity
's
disposition
as
images
of
the
divine
.
Third
,
English
Dominican
mysticism
focused
on
an
embodied
spirituality
with
a
structured
love
of
fellow
men
at
its
center
.
Finally
,
the
supreme
aspiration
of
this
mysticism
was
either
an
ethical
or
an
actual
union
with
God
.
For
English
Dominican
mystics
,
the
mystical
experience
was
not
expressed
just
in
one
moment
of
the
full
knowledge
of
God
,
but
in
the
journey
of
,
or
process
of
,
faith
.
This
then
led
to
an
understanding
that
was
directed
toward
an
experiential
knowledge
of
divinity
.
It
is
important
to
understand
,
however
,
that
for
these
mystics
it
was
possible
to
pursue
mystical
life
without
the
visions
and
voices
that
are
usually
associated
with
such
a
relationship
with
God
.
They
experienced
a
mystical
process
that
allowed
them
,
in
the
end
,
to
experience
what
they
had
already
gained
knowledge
of
through
their
faith
only
.
The
center
of
all
mystical
experience
is
,
of
course
,
Christ
.
English
Dominicans
sought
to
gain
a
full
knowledge
of
Christ
through
an
imitation
of
His
life
.
English
mystics
of
all
types
tended
to
focus
on
the
moral
values
that
the
events
in
Christ
's
life
exemplified
.
This
led
to
a
"
progressive
understanding
of
the
meanings
of
Scripture
--
literal
,
moral
,
allegorical
,
and
anagogical
"
—
that
was
contained
within
the
mystical
journey
itself
.
From
these
considerations
of
Scripture
comes
the
simplest
way
to
imitate
Christ
:
an
emulation
of
the
moral
actions
and
attitudes
that
Jesus
demonstrated
in
His
earthly
ministry
becomes
the
most
significant
way
to
feel
and
have
knowledge
of
God
.
The
English
concentrated
on
the
spirit
of
the
events
of
Christ
's
life
,
not
the
literality
of
events
.
They
neither
expected
nor
sought
the
appearance
of
the
stigmata
or
any
other
physical
manifestation
.
They
wanted
to
create
in
themselves
that
environment
that
allowed
Jesus
to
fulfill
His
divine
mission
,
insofar
as
they
were
able
.
At
the
center
of
this
environment
was
love
:
the
love
that
Christ
showed
for
humanity
in
becoming
human
.
Christ
's
love
reveals
the
mercy
of
God
and
His
care
for
His
creation
.
English
Dominican
mystics
sought
through
this
love
to
become
images
of
God
.
Love
led
to
spiritual
growth
that
,
in
turn
,
reflected
an
increase
in
love
for
God
and
humanity
.
This
increase
in
universal
love
allowed
men's
wills
to
conform
to
God
's
will
,
just
as
Christ
's
will
submitted
to
the
Father
's
will
.
Concerning
humanity
as
the
image
of
Christ
,
English
Dominican
spirituality
concentrated
on
the
moral
implications
of
image-
bearing
rather
than
the
philosophical
foundations
of
the
imago
Dei
.
The
process
of
Christ
's
life
,
and
the
process
of
image
-
bearing
,
amends
humanity
to
God
's
image
.
The
idea
of
the
"
image
of
God
"
demonstrates
both
the
ability
of
man
to
move
toward
God
(
as
partakers
in
Christ
's
redeeming
sacrifice
)
,
and
that
,
on
some
level
,
man
is
always
an
image
of
God
.
As
their
love
and
knowledge
of
God
grows
and
is
sanctified
by
faith
and
experience
,
the
image
of
God
within
man
becomes
ever
more
bright
and
clear
.
Eton
is
one
of
ten
English
HMC
schools
,
commonly
referred
to
as
"
public
schools
"
,
regulated
by
the
Public
Schools
Act
of
1868
.
Following
the
public
school
tradition
,
Eton
is
a
full
boarding
school
,
which
means
all
pupils
live
at
the
school
,
and
it
is
one
of
four
such
remaining
single
-
sex
boys
'
public
schools
in
the
United
Kingdom
(
the
others
being
Harrow
,
Radley
,
and
Winchester
)
to
continue
this
practice
.
Eton
has
educated
19
British
prime
ministers
and
generations
of
the
aristocracy
and
has
been
referred
to
as
the
chief
nurse
of
England
's
statesmen
.
Charging
up
to
£
11,478
per
term
(
there
are
three
terms
per
academic
year
)
in
2014/15
,
Eton
is
the
sixth
most
expensive
HMC
boarding
school
in
the
UK
.
Eton
has
a
long
list
of
distinguished
former
pupils
.
David
Cameron
is
the
19th
British
prime
minister
to
have
attended
the
school
,
and
has
recommended
that
Eton
set
up
a
school
in
the
state
sector
to
help
drive
up
standards
.
Eton
now
co-sponsors
a
state
sixth
-
form
college
in
Newham
,
a
deprived
area
of
East
London
,
called
the
London
Academy
of
Excellence
,
opened
in
2012
,
which
is
free
of
charge
and
aims
to
get
all
its
students
into
higher
education
.
In
September
2014
,
Eton
opened
,
and
became
the
sole
educational
sponsor
for
,
a
new
purpose-
built
co-educational
state
boarding
and
day
school
for
around
500
pupils
,
Holyport
College
,
in
Maidenhead
in
Berkshire
,
with
construction
costing
around
£
15
million
,
in
which
a
fifth
of
places
for
day
pupils
will
be
set
aside
for
children
from
poor
homes
,
21
boarding
places
will
go
to
youngsters
on
the
verge
of
being
taken
into
care
,
and
a
further
28
boarders
will
be
funded
or
part-funded
through
bursaries
.
About
20
%
of
pupils
at
Eton
receive
financial
support
,
through
a
range
of
bursaries
and
scholarships
.
The
recent
Head
Master
,
Tony
Little
,
said
that
Eton
is
developing
plans
to
allow
any
boy
to
attend
the
school
whatever
his
parents
'
income
and
,
in
2011
,
said
that
around
250
boys
received
"
significant
"
financial
help
from
the
school
.
In
early
2014
,
this
figure
had
risen
to
263
pupils
receiving
the
equivalent
of
around
60
%
of
school
fee
assistance
,
whilst
a
further
63
received
their
education
free
of
charge
.
Little
said
that
,
in
the
short
term
,
he
wanted
to
ensure
that
around
320
pupils
per
year
receive
bursaries
,
and
that
70
were
educated
free
of
charge
,
with
the
intention
that
the
number
of
pupils
receiving
financial
assistance
would
continue
to
increase
.
These
comparatively
new
developments
will
run
alongside
long-established
courses
that
Eton
has
provided
for
pupils
from
state
schools
,
most
of
them
in
the
summer
holidays
(
July
and
August
)
.
Launched
in
1982
,
the
Universities
Summer
School
is
an
intensive
residential
course
open
to
boys
and
girls
throughout
the
UK
who
attend
state
schools
,
are
at
the
end
of
their
first
year
in
the
Sixth
Form
,
and
are
about
to
begin
their
final
year
of
schooling
.
The
Brent-Eton
Summer
School
,
started
in
1994
,
offers
40
-
50
young
people
from
the
London
Borough
of
Brent
,
an
area
of
inner-city
deprivation
,
an
intensive
one
-
week
residential
course
,
free
of
charge
,
designed
to
help
bridge
the
gap
between
GCSE
and
A-level
.
In
2008
,
Eton
helped
found
the
Eton
,
Slough
,
Windsor
and
Hounslow
Independent
and
State
School
Partnership
(
ISSP
)
,
with
six
local
state
schools
.
The
ISSP
's
aims
are
"
to
raise
pupil
achievement
,
improve
pupil
self-esteem
,
raise
pupil
aspirations
and
improve
professional
practice
across
the
schools
"
.
Eton
also
runs
a
number
of
choral
and
English
language
courses
during
the
summer
months
.
In
the
run-up
to
the
London
2012
Summer
Olympic
Games
and
London
2012
Summer
Paralympic
Games
,
Eton
's
purpose-
built
Dorney
Lake
,
a
permanent
,
eight
-
lane
,
2,200
metre
course
(
about
1.4
miles
)
in
a
400
-
acre
park
,
officially
known
throughout
the
Games
as
Eton
Dorney
,
provided
training
facilities
for
Olympic
and
Paralympic
competitors
,
and
during
the
Games
,
hosted
the
Olympic
and
Paralympic
Rowing
competitions
as
well
as
the
Olympic
Canoe
Sprint
event
,
attracting
over
400,000
visitors
during
the
Games
period
(
around
30,000
per
day
)
,
and
voted
the
best
2012
Olympic
venue
by
spectators
.
Access
to
the
400
-
acre
parkland
around
the
Lake
is
provided
to
members
of
the
public
,
free
of
charge
,
almost
all
the
year
round
.
Construction
of
the
chapel
,
originally
intended
to
be
slightly
over
twice
as
long
,
with
eighteen
-
or
possibly
seventeen
-
bays
(
there
are
eight
today
)
was
stopped
when
Henry
VI
was
deposed
.
Only
the
Quire
of
the
intended
building
was
completed
.
Eton's
first
Headmaster
,
William
Waynflete
,
founder
of
Magdalen
College
,
Oxford
and
previously
Head
Master
of
Winchester
College
,
built
the
ante-chapel
that
finishes
the
Chapel
today
.
The
important
wall
paintings
in
the
Chapel
and
the
brick
north
range
of
the
present
School
Yard
also
date
from
the
1480s
;
the
lower
storeys
of
the
cloister
,
including
College
Hall
,
had
been
built
between
1441
and
1460
.
As
the
school
suffered
reduced
income
while
still
under
construction
,
the
completion
and
further
development
of
the
school
has
since
depended
to
some
extent
on
wealthy
benefactors
.
Building
resumed
when
Roger
Lupton
was
Provost
,
around
1517
.
His
name
is
borne
by
the
big
gate-house
in
the
west
range
of
the
cloisters
,
fronting
School
Yard
,
perhaps
the
most
famous
image
of
the
school
.
This
range
includes
the
important
interiors
of
the
Parlour
,
Election
Hall
,
and
Election
Chamber
,
where
most
of
the
18th
century
"
leaving
portraits
"
are
kept
.
The
Duke
of
Wellington
is
often
incorrectly
quoted
as
saying
that
"
The
Battle
of
Waterloo
was
won
on
the
playing
-fields
of
Eton
"
.
Wellington
was
at
Eton
from
1781
to
1784
and
was
to
send
his
sons
there
.
According
to
Nevill
(
citing
the
historian
Sir
Edward
Creasy
)
,
what
Wellington
said
,
while
passing
an
Eton
cricket
match
many
decades
later
,
was
,
"
There
grows
the
stuff
that
won
Waterloo
"
,
a
remark
Nevill
construes
as
a
reference
to
"
the
manly
character
induced
by
games
and
sport
"
amongst
English
youth
generally
,
not
a
comment
about
Eton
specifically
.
In
1889
,
Sir
William
Fraser
conflated
this
uncorroborated
remark
with
the
one
attributed
to
him
by
Count
Charles
de
Montalembert
's
"
C'est
ici
qu'a
été
gagné
la
bataille
de
Waterloo
"
(
"
It
is
here
that
the
Battle
of
Waterloo
was
won
.
"
)
As
with
other
public
schools
,
a
scheme
was
devised
towards
the
end
of
the
19th
century
to
familiarize
privileged
schoolboys
with
social
conditions
in
deprived
areas
.
The
project
of
establishing
an
'
Eton
Mission
'
in
the
crowded
district
of
Hackney
Wick
in
east
London
was
started
at
the
beginning
of
1880
,
and
lasted
until
1971
when
it
was
decided
that
a
more
local
project
(
at
Dorney
)
would
be
more
realistic
.
However
over
the
years
much
money
was
raised
for
the
Eton
Mission
,
a
fine
church
by
G.
F.
Bodley
was
erected
,
many
Etonians
visited
,
and
stimulated
among
other
things
the
Eton
Manor
Boys
'
Club
,
a
notable
rowing
club
which
has
survived
the
Mission
itself
,
and
the
59
Club
for
motorcyclists
.
The
very
large
and
ornate
School
Hall
and
School
Library
(
by
L
K.
Hall
)
were
erected
in
1906
-
8
across
the
road
from
Upper
School
as
the
school
's
memorial
to
the
Etonians
who
had
died
in
the
Boer
War
.
Many
tablets
in
the
cloisters
and
chapel
commemorate
the
large
number
of
dead
Etonians
of
the
Great
War
.
A
bomb
destroyed
part
of
Upper
School
in
World
War
Two
and
blew
out
many
windows
in
the
Chapel
.
The
college
commissioned
replacements
by
Evie
Hone
(
1949
–
52
)
and
by
John
Piper
and
Patrick
Reyntiens
(
1959
onwards
)
.
In
the
past
,
people
at
Eton
have
occasionally
been
guilty
of
antisemitism
.
For
a
time
,
new
admissions
were
called
'
Jews
'
by
their
fellow
Collegers
.
In
1945
,
the
school
introduced
a
nationality
statute
conditioning
entry
on
the
applicant
's
father
being
British
by
birth
.
The
statute
was
removed
after
the
intervention
of
Prime
Minister
Harold
Macmillan
in
the
1960s
after
it
came
to
the
attention
of
Oxford
's
Wykeham
Professor
of
Logic
,
A.
J.
Ayer
,
himself
Jewish
and
an
Old
Etonian
,
who
"
suspected
a
whiff
of
anti-semitism
"
.
One
boarding
house
,
College
,
is
reserved
for
seventy
King
's
Scholars
,
who
attend
Eton
on
scholarships
provided
by
the
original
foundation
and
awarded
by
examination
each
year
;
King
's
Scholars
pay
up
to
90
%
of
full
fees
,
depending
on
their
means
.
Of
the
other
pupils
,
up
to
a
third
receive
some
kind
of
bursary
or
scholarship
.
The
name
"
King
's
Scholars
"
is
because
the
school
was
founded
by
King
Henry
VI
in
1440
.
The
original
School
consisted
of
the
seventy
Scholars
(
together
with
some
Commensals
)
and
the
Scholars
were
educated
and
boarded
at
the
foundation
's
expense
.
As
the
School
grew
,
more
students
were
allowed
to
attend
provided
that
they
paid
their
own
fees
and
lived
in
the
town
,
outside
the
College
's
original
buildings
.
These
students
became
known
as
Oppidans
,
from
the
Latin
word
oppidum
,
meaning
town
.
The
Houses
developed
over
time
as
a
means
of
providing
residence
for
the
Oppidans
in
a
more
congenial
manner
,
and
during
the
18th
and
19th
centuries
were
mostly
run
by
women
known
as
"
dames
"
.
They
typically
contain
about
fifty
boys
.
Although
classes
are
organised
on
a
School
basis
,
most
boys
spend
a
large
proportion
of
their
time
in
their
House
.
Each
House
has
a
formal
name
,
mainly
used
for
post
and
people
outside
the
Eton
community
.
It
is
generally
known
by
the
boys
by
the
initials
or
surname
of
the
House
Master
,
the
teacher
who
lives
in
the
house
and
manages
the
pupils
in
it
.
Not
all
boys
who
pass
the
College
election
examination
choose
to
become
King
's
Scholars
.
If
they
choose
instead
to
belong
to
one
of
the
24
Oppidan
Houses
,
they
are
known
as
Oppidan
Scholars
.
Oppidan
scholarships
may
also
be
awarded
for
consistently
performing
with
distinction
in
School
and
external
examinations
.
To
gain
an
Oppidan
Scholarship
,
a
boy
must
have
either
three
distinctions
in
a
row
or
four
throughout
his
career
.
Within
the
school
,
an
Oppidan
Scholar
is
entitled
to
use
the
letters
OS
after
his
name
.
The
Oppidan
Houses
are
named
Godolphin
House
,
Jourdelay's
,
(
both
built
as
such
c.
1720
)
,
Hawtrey
House
,
Durnford
House
,
(
the
first
two
built
as
such
by
the
Provost
and
Fellows
,
1845
,
when
the
school
was
increasing
in
numbers
and
needed
more
centralised
control

For
much
of
Eton
's
history
,
junior
boys
had
to
act
as
"
fags
"
,
or
servants
,
to
older
boys
.
Their
duties
included
cleaning
,
cooking
,
and
running
errands
.
A
Library
member
was
entitled
to
yell
at
any
time
and
without
notice
,
"
Boy
,
Up
!
"
or
"
Boy
,
Queue
!
"
,
and
all
first
-
year
boys
had
to
come
running
.
The
last
boy
to
arrive
was
given
the
task
.
These
practices
,
known
as
fagging
,
were
partially
phased
out
of
most
houses
in
the
1970s
.
Captains
of
House
and
Games
still
sometimes
give
tasks
to
first
-
year
boys
,
such
as
collecting
the
mail
from
School
Office
.

The
long-standing
claim
that
the
present
uniform
was
first
worn
as
mourning
for
the
death
of
George
III
is
unfounded
.
"
Eton
dress
"
has
undergone
significant
changes
since
its
standardisation
in
the
19th
century
.
Originally
(
along
with
a
top-hat
and
walking
-cane
)
,
Etonian
dress
was
reserved
for
formal
occasions
,
but
boys
wear
it
today
for
classes
,
which
are
referred
to
as
"
divisions
"
,
or
"
divs
"
.
As
stated
above
,
King
's
Scholars
wear
a
black
gown
over
the
top
of
their
tailcoats
,
and
occasionally
a
surplice
in
Chapel
.
Members
of
the
teaching
staff
(
known
as
Beaks
)
are
required
to
wear
a
form
of
school
dress
when
teaching
.
Later
the
emphasis
was
on
classical
studies
,
dominated
by
Latin
and
Ancient
History
,
and
,
for
boys
with
sufficient
ability
,
Classical
Greek
.
From
the
latter
part
of
the
19th
century
this
curriculum
has
changed
and
broadened
:
for
example
,
there
are
now
more
than
100
students
of
Chinese
,
which
is
a
non-curriculum
course
.
In
the
1970s
,
there
was
just
one
school
computer
,
in
a
small
room
attached
to
the
science
buildings
.
It
used
paper
tape
to
store
programs
.
Today
,
all
boys
must
have
laptop
computers
,
and
the
school
fibre-optic
network
connects
all
classrooms
and
all
boys
'
bedrooms
to
the
internet
.
The
primary
responsibility
for
a
boy
's
studies
lies
with
his
House
Master
,
but
he
is
assisted
by
an
additional
director
of
studies
,
known
as
a
tutor
.
Classes
,
colloquially
known
as
"
divs
"
(
divisions
)
,
are
organised
on
a
School
basis
;
the
classrooms
are
separate
from
the
houses
.
New
school
buildings
have
appeared
for
teaching
purposes
every
decade
or
so
since
New
Schools
,
designed
by
Henry
Woodyer
and
built
1861
-
3
.
Despite
the
introduction
of
modern
technology
,
the
external
appearance
and
locations
of
many
of
the
classrooms
have
remained
unchanged
for
a
long
time
.
Societies
tend
to
come
and
go
,
of
course
,
depending
on
the
special
enthusiasms
of
the
masters
and
boys
in
the
school
at
the
time
,
but
some
have
been
in
existence
many
years
.
Those
in
existence
at
present
include
:
Aeronautical
,
African
,
Alexander
Cozens
(
Art
)
,
Amnesty
,
Archeological
,
Architectural

Various
benefactions
make
it
possible
to
give
grants
each
year
to
boys
who
wish
,
for
educational
or
cultural
reasons
,
to
work
or
travel
abroad
.
These
include
the
Busk
Fund
,
which
supports
individual
ventures
that
show
particular
initiative
;
the
C.M.
Wells
Memorial
Trust
Fund
,
for
the

enter
the
Foreign
Service
;
and
the
Marsden
Fund
,
for
travel
in
countries
where
the
principal
language
is
not
English
.
If
any
boy
produces
an
outstanding
piece
of
work
,
it
may
be
"
Sent
Up
For
Good
"
,
storing
the
effort
in
the
College
Archives
for
posterity
.
This
award
has
been
around
since
the
18th
century
.
As
Sending
Up
For
Good
is
fairly
infrequent
,
the
process
is
rather
mysterious
to
many
of
Eton
's
boys
.
First
,
the
master
wishing
to
Send
Up
For
Good
must
gain
the
permission
of
the
relevant
Head
of
Department
.
Upon
receiving
his
or
her
approval
,
the
piece
of
work
will
be
marked
with
Sent
Up
For
Good
and
the
student
will
receive
a
card
to
be
signed
by
House
Master
,
tutor
and
division
master
.
The
opposite
of
a
Show
Up
is
a
"
Rip
"
.
This
is
for
sub-standard
work
,
which
is
sometimes
torn
at
the
top
of
the
page
/
sheet
and
must
be
submitted
to
the
boy
's
housemaster
for
signature
.
Boys
who
accumulate
rips
are
liable
to
be
given
a
"
White
Ticket
"
,
which
must
be
signed
by
all
his
teachers
and
may
be
accompanied
by
other
punishments
,
usually
involving
doing
domestic
chores
or
writing
lines
.
In
recent
times
,
[
when
?
]
a
milder
form
of
the
rip
,
'
sign
for
information
'
,
colloquially
known
as
an
"
info
"
,
has
been
introduced
,
which
must
also
be
signed
by
the
boy
's
housemaster
and
tutor
.
A
boy
who
is
late
for
any
division
or
other
appointment
may
be
required
to
sign
"
Tardy
Book
"
,
a
register
kept
in
the
School
Office
,
between
7.35
am
and
7.45
am
,
every
morning
for
the
duration
of
his
sentence
(
typically
three
days
)
.
Tardy
Book
may
also
be
issued
for
late
work
.
For
more
serious
misdeeds
,
a
boy
is
summoned
from
his
lessons
to
the
Head
Master
,
or
Lower
Master
if
the
boy
is
in
the
lower
two
years
,
to
talk
personally
about
his
misdeeds
.
This
is
known
as
the
"
Bill
"
.
The
most
serious
misdeeds
may
result
in
expulsion
,
or
rustication
(
suspension
)
.
Conversely
,
should
a
master
be
more
than
15
minutes
late
for
a
class
,
traditionally
the
pupils
might
claim
it
as
a
"
run
"
and
absent
themselves
for
the
rest
of
its
duration
.
John
Keate
,
Head
Master
from
1809
to
1834
,
took
over
at
a
time
when
discipline
was
poor
.
Anthony
Chenevix
-Trench
,
Head
Master
from
1964
to
1970
,
abolished
the
birch
and
replaced
it
with
caning
,
also
applied
to
the
bare
posterior
,
which
he
administered
privately
in
his
office
.
Chenevix
-
Trench
also
abolished
corporal
punishment
administered
by
senior
boys
.
Previously
,
House
Captains
were
permitted
to
cane
miscreants
over
the
seat
of
the
trousers
.
This
was
a
routine
occurrence
,
carried
out
privately
with
the
boy
bending
over
with
his
head
under
the
edge
of
a
table
.
Less
common
but
more
severe
were
the
canings
administered
by
Pop
(
see
Eton
Society
below
)
in
the
form
of
a
"
Pop-
Tanning
"
,
in
which
a
large
number
of
hard
strokes
were
inflicted
by
the
President
of
Pop
in
the
presence
of
all
Pop
members
(
or
,
in
earlier
times
,
each
member
of
Pop
took
it
in
turns
to
inflict
a
stroke
)
.
The
culprit
was
summoned
to
appear
in
a
pair
of
old
trousers
,
as
the
caning
would
cut
the
cloth
to
shreds
.
This
was
the
most
severe
form
of
physical
punishment
at
Eton
.
The
current
"
Precentor
"
(
Head
of
Music
)
is
Tim
Johnson
,
and
the
School
boasts
eight
organs
and
an
entire
building
for
music
(
performance
spaces
include
the
School
Hall
,
the
Farrer
Theatre
and
two
halls
dedicated
to
music
,
the
Parry
Hall
and
the
Concert
Hall
)
.
Many
instruments
are
taught
,
including
obscure
ones
such
as
the
didgeridoo
.
The
School
participates
in
many
national
competitions
;
many
pupils
are
part
of
the
National
Youth
Orchestra
,
and
the
School
gives
scholarships
for
dedicated
and
talented
musicians
.
A
former
Precentor
of
the
college
,
Ralph
Allwood
set
up
and
organised
Eton
Choral
Courses
,
which
run
at
the
School
every
summer
.
Numerous
plays
are
put
on
every
year
at
Eton
College
;
there
is
one
main
theatre
,
called
the
Farrer
(
seating
400
)
and
2
Studio
theatres
,
called
the
Caccia
Studio
and
Empty
Space
(
seating
90
and
80
respectively
)
.
There
are
about
8
or
9
house
productions
each
year
,
around
3
or
4
"
independent
"
plays
(
not
confined
solely
to
one
house
,
produced
,
directed
and
funded
by
Etonians
)
and
three
school
plays
,
one
specifically
for
boys
in
the
first
two
years
,
and
two
open
to
all
years
.
The
School
Plays
have
such
good
reputations
that
they
are
normally
fully
booked
every
night
.
Productions
also
take
place
in
varying
locations
around
the
School
,
varying
from
the
sports
fields
to
more
historic
buildings
such
as
Upper
School
and
College
Chapel
.
In
recent
years
,
the
School
has
put
on
a
musical
version
of
The
Bacchae
(
October
2009
)
as
well
as
productions
of
A
Funny
Thing
Happened
on
the
Way
to
the
Forum
(
May
2010
)
,
The
Cherry

.
Upcoming
in
May
2014
was
a
production
of
A

Eton
's
best-known
holiday
takes
place
on
the
so-called
"
Fourth
of
June
"
,
a
celebration
of
the
birthday
of
King
George
III
,
Eton
's
greatest
patron
.
This
day
is
celebrated
with
the
Procession
of
Boats
,
in
which
the
top
rowing
crews
from
the
top
four
years
row
past
in
vintage
wooden
rowing
boats
.
Similar
to
the
Queen's
Official
Birthday
,
the
"
Fourth
of
June
"
is
no
longer
celebrated
on
4
June
,
but
on
the
Wednesday
before
the
first
weekend
of
June
.
Eton
also
observes
St.
Andrew
's
Day
,
on
which
the
Eton
wall
game
is
played
.

Until
18
December
2010
,
Eton
College
was
an
exempt
charity
under
English
law
(
Charities
Act
1993
,
Schedule
2
)
.
Under
the
provisions
of
the
Charities
Act
2006
,
it
is
now
an
excepted
charity
,
and
fully
registered
with
the
Charities
Commission
,
and
is
now
one
of
the
100
largest
charities
in
the
UK
.
As
a
charity
,
it
benefits
from
substantial
tax
breaks
.
It
was
calculated
by
the
late
David
Jewell
,
former
Master
of
Haileybury
,
that
in
1992
such
tax
breaks
saved
the
School
about
£
1,945
per
pupil
per
year
,
although
he
had
no
direct
connection
with
the
School
.
This
subsidy
has
declined
since
the
2001
abolition
by
the
Labour
Government
of
state
-funded
scholarships
(
formerly
known
as
"
assisted
places
"
)
to
independent
schools
.
However
,
no
child
attended
Eton
on
this
scheme
,
meaning
that
the
actual
level
of
state
assistance
to
the
School
has
always
been
lower
.
Eton's
retiring
Head
Master
,
Tony
Little
,
has
claimed
that
the
benefits
that
Eton
provides
to
the
local
community
free
of
charge
(
use
of
its
facilities
,
etc.
)
have
a
higher
value
than
the
tax
breaks
it
receives
as
a
result
of
its
charitable
status
.
The
fee
for
the
academic
year
2010
–
2011
was
£
29,862
(
approximately
US
$
48,600
or
€
35,100
as
of
March
2011
)
,
although
the
sum
is
considerably
lower
for
those
pupils
on
bursaries
and
scholarships
.
In
1995
the
National
Lottery
granted
money
for
a
£
4.6
m
sports
complex
,
to
add
to
Eton
's
existing
facilities
of
two
swimming
pools
,
30
cricket
squares
,
24
football
,
rugby
and
hockey
pitches
and
a
gym
.
The
College
paid
£
200,000
and
contributed
4.5
hectares
of
land
in
return
for
exclusive
use
of
the
facilities
during
the
daytime
only
.
The
UK
Sports
Council
defended
the
deal
on
the
grounds
that
the
whole
community
would
benefit
,
while
the
bursar
claimed
that
Windsor
,
Slough
and
Eton
Athletic
Club
was
"
deprived
"
because
local
people
(
who
were
not
pupils
at
the
College
)
did
not
have
a
world
-
class
running
track
and
facilities
to
train
with
.
Steve
Osborn
,
director
of
the
Safe
Neighbourhoods
Unit
,
described
the
decision
as
"
staggering
"
given
the
background
of
a
substantial
reduction
in
youth
services
by
councils
across
the
country
,
a
matter
over
which
,
however
,
neither
the
College
nor
the
UK
Sports
Council
,
had
any
control
.
The
facility
,
which
became
the
Thames
Valley
Athletics
Centre
,
opened
in
April
1999
.
In
October
2004
,
Sarah
Forsyth
claimed
that
she
had
been
dismissed
unfairly
by
Eton
College
and
had
been
bullied
by
senior
staff
.
She
also
claimed
she
was
instructed
to
do
some
of
Prince
Harry
's
coursework
to
enable
him
to
pass
AS
Art
.
As
evidence
,
Forsyth
provided
secretly
recorded
conversations
with
both
Prince
Harry
and
her
Head
of
Department
,
Ian
Burke
.
An
employment
tribunal
in
July
2005
found
that
she
had
been
unfairly
dismissed
and
criticised
Burke
for
bullying
her
and
for
repeatedly
changing
his
story
.
It
also
criticised
the
school
for
failing
to
produce
its
capability
procedures
and
criticised
the
Head
Master
for
not
reviewing
the
case
independently
.
It
criticised
Forsyth
's
decision
to
record
a
conversation
with
Harry
as
an
abuse
of
teacher–student
confidentiality
and
said
"
It
is
clear
whichever
version
of
the
evidence
is
accepted
that
Mr
Burke
did
ask
the
claimant
to
assist
Prince
Harry
with
text
for
his
expressive
art
project
...
It
is
not
part
of
this
tribunal
's
function
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
was
legitimate
.
"
In
response
to
the
tribunal
's
ruling
concerning
the
allegations
about
Prince
Harry
,
the
School
issued
a
statement
,
saying
Forsyth
's
claims
"
were
dismissed
for
what
they
always
have
been
-
unfounded
and
irrelevant
.
"
A
spokesperson
from
Clarence
House
said
,
"
We
are
delighted
that
Harry
has
been
totally
cleared
of
cheating
.
"
In
2005
,
the
Office
of
Fair
Trading
found
fifty
independent
schools
,
including
Eton
,
to
have
breached
the
Competition
Act
by
"
regularly
and
systematically
"
exchanging
information
about
planned
increases
in
school
fees
,
which
was
collated
and
distributed
among
the
schools
by
the
bursar
at
Sevenoaks
School
.
Following
the
investigation
by
the
OFT
,
each
school
was
required
to
pay
around
£
70,000
,
totalling
around
£
3.5
million
,
significantly
less
than
the
maximum
possible
fine
.
In
addition
,
the
schools
together
agreed
to
contribute
another
£
3
m
to
a
new
charitable
educational
fund
.
The
incident
raised
concerns
over
whether
the
charitable
status
of
independent
schools
such
as
Eton
should
be
reconsidered
,
and
perhaps
revoked
.
However
,
Jean
Scott
,
the
head
of
the
Independent
Schools
Council
,
said
that
independent
schools
had
always
been
exempt
from
anti-cartel
rules
applied
to
business
,
were
following
a
long-established
procedure
in
sharing
the
information
with
each
other
,
and
that
they
were
unaware
of
the
change
to
the
law
(
on
which
they
had
not
been
consulted
)
.
She
wrote
to
John
Vickers
,
the
OFT
director-general
,
saying
,
"
They
are
not
a
group
of
businessmen
meeting
behind
closed
doors
to
fix
the
price
of
their
products
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
consumer
.
They
are
schools
that
have
quite
openly
continued
to
follow
a
long-established
practice
because
they
were
unaware
that
the
law
had
changed
.
"
A
Freedom
of
Information
request
in
2005
revealed
that
Eton
had
received
£
2,652
in
farming
subsidies
in
2004
under
the
Common
Agricultural
Policy
.
Asked
to
explain
under
what
grounds
it
was
eligible
to
receive
farming
subsidies
,
Eton
admitted
that
it
was
'
a
bit
of
a
mystery
'
.
The
TaxPayers
'
Alliance
also
stated
that
Eton
had
received
a
total
of
£
5,300
in
CAP
subsidies
between
2002
and

Panorama
revealed
in
March
2012
that
farming
subsidies
were
granted
to
Eton
for
'
environmental
improvements
'
,
in
effect
'
being
paid
without
having
to
do
any
farming
at
all
'
.
Figures
obtained
by
The
Daily
Telegraph
had
revealed
that
,
in
2010
,
37
applicants
from
Eton
were
accepted
by
Oxford
whilst
state
schools
had
difficulty
obtaining
entry
even
for
pupils
with
the
country
's
most
impressive
exam
results
.
According
to
The
Economist
,
Oxford
and
Cambridge
admit
more
Etonians
each
year
than
applicants
from
the
whole
country
who
qualify
for
free
school
meals
.
In
April
2011
the
Labour
MP
David
Lammy
described
as
unfair
and
'
indefensible
'
the
fact
that
Oxford
University
had
organised
nine
'
outreach
events
'
at
Eton
in
2010
,
although
he
admitted
that
it
had
,
in
fact
,
held
fewer
such
events
for
Eton
than
for
another
independent
school
,
Wellington
College
.
In
July
2015
,
Eton
accidentally
sent
emails
to
400
prospective
students
,
offering
them
conditional
entrance
to
the
school
in
September
2017
.
The
email
was
intended
for
nine
students
,
but
an
IT
glitch
caused
the
email
to
be
sent
to
400
additional
families
,
who
did
n't
necessarily
have
a
place
.
In
response
,
the
school
issued
the
following
statement
:
"
This
error
was
discovered
within
minutes
and
each
family
was
immediately
contacted
to
notify
them
that
it
should
be
disregarded
and
to
apologise
.
We
take
this
type
of
incident
very
seriously
indeed
and
so
a
thorough
investigation
,
overseen
by
the
headmaster
Tony
Little
and
led
by
the
tutor
for
admissions
,
is
being
carried
out
to
find
out
exactly
what
went
wrong
and
ensure
it
cannot
happen
again
.
Eton
College
offers
its
sincere
apologies
to
those
boys
concerned
and
their
families
.
We
deeply
regret
the
confusion
and
upset
this
must
have
caused
.

In
January
2016
,
the
Eton
College
beagling
club
was
accused
by
the
League
Against
Cruel
Sports
of
undertaking
an
illegal
hare
hunt
.
The
allegations
were
accompanied
by
a
video
of
the
Eton
Beagles
chasing
a
hare
,
as
'
the
hunt
staff
urge
the
beagles
on
and
make
no
efforts
to
call
the
dogs
off
.
'
A
spokesman
representing
Eton
College
released
the
following
statement
:
"
Eton
College
takes
its
legal
responsibilities
extremely
seriously
and
expects
all
school
activities
to
comply
with
the
law
.
We
are
investigating
this
allegation
as
a
matter
of
urgency
and
will
be
co-operating
fully
with
the
relevant
authorities

Actor
Dominic
West
has
been
unenthusiastic
about
the
career
benefits
of
being
an
Old
Etonian
,
saying
it
"
is
a
stigma
that
is
slightly
above
'
paedophile
'
in
the
media
in
a
gallery
of
infamy
"
,
but
asked
whether
he
would
consider
sending
his
own
children
there
,
said
"
Yes
,
I
would
.
It
’s
an
extraordinary
place
...
It
has
the
facilities
and
the
excellence
of
teaching
and
it
will
find
what
you
’re
good
at
and
nurture
it
"
,
while
the
actor
Tom
Hiddleston
says
there
are
widespread
misconceptions
about
Eton
,
and
that
"
People
think
it
's
just
full
of
braying
toffs
...
It
is
n’t
true
...
It
's
actually
one
of
the
most
broadminded
places
I
’ve
ever
been
.
The
reason
it
’s
a
good
school
is
that
it
encourages
people
to
find
the
thing
they
love
and
to
go
for
it
.
They
champion
the
talent
of
the
individual
and
that
’s
what
’s
special
about
it
"
.
Cambridge
English
Dictionary
states
that
culture
is
,
"
the
way
of
life
,
especially
the
general
customs
and
beliefs
,
of
a
particular
group
of
people
at
a
particular
time
.
"
Terror
Management
Theory
posits
that
culture
is
a
series
of
activities
and
worldviews
that
provide
humans
with
the
illusion
of
being
individuals
of
value
in
a
world
meaning
—
raising
themselves
above
the
merely
physical
aspects
of
existence
,
in
order
to
deny
the
animal
insignificance
and
death
that
Homo
Sapiens
became
aware
of
when
they
acquired
a
larger
brain
.
As
a
defining
aspect
of
what
it
means
to
be
human
,
culture
is
a
central
concept
in
anthropology
,
encompassing
the
range
of
phenomena
that
are
transmitted
through
social
learning
in
human
societies
.
The
word
is
used
in
a
general
sense
as
the
evolved
ability
to
categorize
and
represent
experiences
with
symbols
and
to
act
imaginatively
and
creatively
.
This
ability
arose
with
the
evolution
of
behavioral
modernity
in
humans
around
50,000
years
ago
.

This
capacity
is
often
thought
to
be
unique
to
humans
,
although
some
other
species
have
demonstrated
similar
,
though
much
less
complex
abilities
for
social
learning
.
It
is
also
used
to
denote
the
complex
networks
of
practices
and
accumulated
knowledge
and
ideas
that
is
transmitted
through
social
interaction
and
exist
in
specific
human
groups
,
or
cultures
,
using
the
plural
form
.
Some
aspects
of
human
behavior
,
such
as
language
,
social
practices
such
as
kinship
,
gender
and
marriage
,
expressive
forms
such
as
art
,
music
,
dance
,
ritual
,
religion
,
and
technologies
such
as
cooking
,
shelter
,
clothing
are
said
to
be
cultural
universals
,
found
in
all
human
societies
.
The
concept
material
culture
covers
the
physical
expressions
of
culture
,
such
as
technology
,
architecture
and
art
,
whereas
the
immaterial
aspects
of
culture
such
as
principles
of
social
organization
(
including
,
practices
of
political
organization
and
social
institutions
)
,
mythology
,
philosophy
,
literature
(
both
written
and
oral
)
,
and
science
make
up
the
intangible
cultural
heritage
of
a
society
.
In
the
humanities
,
one
sense
of
culture
,
as
an
attribute
of
the
individual
,
has
been
the
degree
to
which
they
have
cultivated
a
particular
level
of
sophistication
,
in
the
arts
,
sciences
,
education
,
or
manners
.
The
level
of
cultural
sophistication
has
also
sometimes
been
seen
to
distinguish
civilizations
from
less
complex
societies
.
Such
hierarchical
perspectives
on
culture
are
also
found
in
class-
based
distinctions
between
a
high
culture
of
the
social
elite
and
a
low
culture
,
popular
culture
or
folk
culture
of
the
lower
classes
,
distinguished
by
the
stratified
access
to
cultural
capital
.
In
common
parlance
,
culture
is
often
used
to
refer
specifically
to
the
symbolic
markers
used
by
ethnic
groups
to
distinguish
themselves
visibly
from
each
other
such
as
body
modification
,
clothing
or
jewelry
.

Mass
culture
refers
to
the
mass-produced
and
mass
mediated
forms
of
consumer
culture
that
emerged
in
the
20th
century
.
Some
schools
of
philosophy
,
such
as
Marxism
and
critical
theory
,
have
argued
that
culture
is
often
used
politically
as
a
tool
of
the
elites
to
manipulate
the
lower
classes
and
create
a
false
consciousness
,
such
perspectives
common
in
the
discipline
of
cultural
studies
.
In
the
wider
social
sciences
,
the
theoretical
perspective
of
cultural
materialism
holds
that
human
symbolic
culture
arises
from
the
material
conditions
of
human
life
,
as
humans
create
the
conditions
for
physical
survival
,
and
that
the
basis
of
culture
is
found
in
evolved
biological
dispositions
.
When
used
as
a
count
noun
"
a
culture
"
,
is
the
set
of
customs
,
traditions
and
values
of
a
society
or
community
,
such
as
an
ethnic
group
or
nation
.
In
this
sense
,
multiculturalism
is
a
concept
that
values
the
peaceful
coexistence
and
mutual
respect
between
different
cultures
inhabiting
the
same
territory
.
Sometimes
"
culture
"
is
also
used
to
describe
specific
practices
within
a
subgroup
of
a
society
,
a
subculture
(
e.g.
"
bro
culture
"
)
,
or
a
counter
culture
.
Within
cultural
anthropology
,
the
ideology
and
analytical
stance
of
cultural
relativism
holds
that
cultures
cannot
easily
be
objectively
ranked
or
evaluated
because
any
evaluation
is
necessarily
situated
within
the
value
system
of
a
given
culture
.
The
modern
term
"
culture
"
is
based
on
a
term
used
by
the
Ancient
Roman
orator
Cicero
in
his
Tusculanae
Disputationes
,
where
he
wrote
of
a
cultivation
of
the
soul
or
"
cultura
animi
"
,
using
an
agricultural
metaphor
for
the
development
of
a
philosophical
soul
,
understood
teleologically
as
the
highest
possible
ideal
for
human
development
.
Samuel
Pufendorf
took
over
this
metaphor
in
a
modern
context
,
meaning
something
similar
,
but
no
longer
assuming
that
philosophy
was
man
's
natural
perfection
.
His
use
,
and
that
of
many
writers
after
him
"
refers
to
all
the
ways
in
which
human
beings
overcome
their
original
barbarism
,
and
through
artifice
,
become
fully
human
"
.
Social
conflict
and
the
development
of
technologies
can
produce
changes
within
a
society
by
altering
social
dynamics
and
promoting
new
cultural
models
,
and
spurring
or
enabling
generative
action
.
These
social
shifts
may
accompany
ideological
shifts
and
other
types
of
cultural
change
.
For
example
,
the
U.S.
feminist
movement
involved
new
practices
that
produced
a
shift
in
gender
relations
,
altering
both
gender
and
economic
structures
.
Environmental
conditions
may
also
enter
as
factors
.
For
example
,
after
tropical
forests
returned
at
the
end
of
the
last
ice
age
,
plants
suitable
for
domestication
were
available
,
leading
to
the
invention
of
agriculture
,
which
in
turn
brought
about
many
cultural
innovations
and
shifts
in
social
dynamics
.
Cultures
are
externally
affected
via
contact
between
societies
,
which
may
also
produce
—
or
inhibit
—
social
shifts
and
changes
in
cultural
practices
.
War
or
competition
over
resources
may
impact
technological
development
or
social
dynamics
.
Additionally
,
cultural
ideas
may
transfer
from
one
society
to
another
,
through
diffusion
or
acculturation
.
In
diffusion
,
the
form
of
something
(
though
not
necessarily
its
meaning
)
moves
from
one
culture
to
another
.
For
example
,
hamburgers
,
fast
food
in
the
United
States
,
seemed
exotic
when
introduced
into
China
.
"
Stimulus
diffusion
"
(
the
sharing
of
ideas
)
refers
to
an
element
of
one
culture
leading
to
an
invention
or
propagation
in
another
.
"
Direct
Borrowing
"
on
the
other
hand
tends
to
refer
to
technological
or
tangible
diffusion
from
one
culture
to
another
.
Diffusion
of
innovations
theory
presents
a
research
-
based
model
of
why
and
when
individuals
and
cultures
adopt
new
ideas
,
practices
,
and
products
.
Immanuel
Kant
(
1724
–
1804
)
has
formulated
an
individualist
definition
of
"
enlightenment
"
similar
to
the
concept
of
bildung
:
"
Enlightenment
is
man
's
emergence
from
his
self-
incurred
immaturity
.
"
He
argued
that
this
immaturity
comes
not
from
a
lack
of
understanding
,
but
from
a
lack
of
courage
to
think
independently
.
Against
this
intellectual
cowardice
,
Kant
urged
:
Sapere
aude
,
"
Dare
to
be
wise
!
"
In
reaction
to
Kant
,
German
scholars
such
as
Johann
Gottfried
Herder
(
1744
–
1803
)
argued
that
human
creativity
,
which
necessarily
takes
unpredictable
and
highly
diverse
forms
,
is
as
important
as
human
rationality
.
Moreover
,
Herder
proposed
a
collective
form
of
bildung
:
"
For
Herder
,
Bildung
was
the
totality
of
experiences
that
provide
a
coherent
identity
,
and
sense
of
common
destiny
,
to
a
people
.
"
In
1795
,
the
Prussian
linguist
and
philosopher
Wilhelm
von
Humboldt
(
1767
–
1835
)
called
for
an
anthropology
that
would
synthesize
Kant
's
and
Herder
's
interests
.
During
the
Romantic
era
,
scholars
in
Germany
,
especially
those
concerned
with
nationalist
movements
—
such
as
the
nationalist
struggle
to
create
a
"
Germany
"
out
of
diverse
principalities
,
and
the
nationalist
struggles
by
ethnic
minorities
against
the
Austro-Hungarian
Empire
—
developed
a
more
inclusive
notion
of
culture
as
"
worldview
"
(
Weltanschauung
)
.
According
to
this
school
of
thought
,
each
ethnic
group
has
a
distinct
worldview
that
is
incommensurable
with
the
worldviews
of
other
groups
.
Although
more
inclusive
than
earlier
views
,
this
approach
to
culture
still
allowed
for
distinctions
between
"
civilized
"
and
"
primitive
"
or
"
tribal
"
cultures
.
In
1860
,
Adolf
Bastian
(
1826–
1905
)
argued
for
"
the
psychic
unity
of
mankind
"
.
He
proposed
that
a
scientific
comparison
of
all
human
societies
would
reveal
that
distinct
worldviews
consisted
of
the
same
basic
elements
.
According
to
Bastian
,
all
human
societies
share
a
set
of
"
elementary
ideas
"
(
Elementargedanken
)
;
different
cultures
,
or
different
"
folk
ideas
"
(
Völkergedanken
)
,
are
local
modifications
of
the
elementary
ideas
.
This
view
paved
the
way
for
the
modern
understanding
of
culture
.
Franz
Boas
(
1858
–
1942
)
was
trained
in
this
tradition
,
and
he
brought
it
with
him
when
he
left
Germany
for
the
United
States
.
In
practice
,
culture
referred
to
an
élite
ideal
and
was
associated
with
such
activities
as
art
,
classical
music
,
and
haute
cuisine
.
As
these
forms
were
associated
with
urban
life
,
"
culture
"
was
identified
with
"
civilization
"
(
from
lat
.
civitas
,
city
)
.
Another
facet
of
the
Romantic
movement
was
an
interest
in
folklore
,
which
led
to
identifying
a
"
culture
"
among
non-elites
.
This
distinction
is
often
characterized
as
that
between
high
culture
,
namely
that
of
the
ruling
social
group
,
and
low
culture
.
In
other
words
,
the
idea
of
"
culture
"
that
developed
in
Europe
during
the
18th
and
early
19th
centuries
reflected
inequalities
within
European
societies
.
Matthew
Arnold
contrasted
"
culture
"
with
anarchy
;
other
Europeans
,
following
philosophers
Thomas
Hobbes
and
Jean-Jacques
Rousseau
,
contrasted
"
culture
"
with
"
the
state
of
nature
"
.
According
to
Hobbes
and
Rousseau
,
the
Native
Americans
who
were
being
conquered
by
Europeans
from
the
16th
centuries
on
were
living
in
a
state
of
nature
;
this
opposition
was
expressed
through
the
contrast
between
"
civilized
"
and
"
uncivilized
.
"
According
to
this
way
of
thinking
,
one
could
classify
some
countries
and
nations
as
more
civilized
than
others
and
some
people
as
more
cultured
than
others
.
This
contrast
led
to
Herbert
Spencer
's
theory
of
Social
Darwinism
and
Lewis
Henry
Morgan
's
theory
of
cultural
evolution
.
Just
as
some
critics
have
argued
that
the
distinction
between
high
and
low
cultures
is
really
an
expression
of
the
conflict
between
European
elites
and
non-elites
,
some
critics
have
argued
that
the
distinction
between
civilized
and
uncivilized
people
is
really
an
expression
of
the
conflict
between
European
colonial
powers
and
their
colonial
subjects
.
Other
19th
-
century
critics
,
following
Rousseau
have
accepted
this
differentiation
between
higher
and
lower
culture
,
but
have
seen
the
refinement
and
sophistication
of
high
culture
as
corrupting
and
unnatural
developments
that
obscure
and
distort
people
's
essential
nature
.
These
critics
considered
folk
music
(
as
produced
by
"
the
folk
"
,
i.e.
,
rural
,
illiterate
,
peasants
)
to
honestly
express
a
natural
way
of
life
,
while
classical
music
seemed
superficial
and
decadent
.
Equally
,
this
view
often
portrayed
indigenous
peoples
as
"
noble
savages
"
living
authentic
and
unblemished
lives
,
uncomplicated
and
uncorrupted
by
the
highly
stratified
capitalist
systems
of
the
West
.
Although
anthropologists
worldwide
refer
to
Tylor
's
definition
of
culture
,
in
the
20th
century
"
culture
"
emerged
as
the
central
and
unifying
concept
of
American
anthropology
,
where
it
most
commonly
refers
to
the
universal
human
capacity
to
classify
and
encode
human
experiences
symbolically
,
and
to
communicate
symbolically
encoded
experiences
socially
.

American
anthropology
is
organized
into
four
fields
,
each
of
which
plays
an
important
role
in
research
on
culture
:
biological
anthropology
,
linguistic
anthropology
,
cultural
anthropology
,
and
archaeology
.
The
sociology
of
culture
concerns
culture
—
usually
understood
as
the
ensemble
of
symbolic
codes
used
by
a
society
—
as
manifested
in
society
.
For
Georg
Simmel
(
1858
–
1918
)
,
culture
referred
to
"
the
cultivation
of
individuals
through
the
agency
of
external
forms
which
have
been
objectified
in
the
course
of
history
"
.
Culture
in
the
sociological
field
can
be
defined
as
the
ways
of
thinking
,
the
ways
of
acting
,
and
the
material
objects
that
together
shape
a
people
's
way
of
life
.
Culture
can
be
any
of
two
types
,
non-material
culture
or
material
culture
.
Non-material
culture
refers
to
the
non
physical
ideas
that
individuals
have
about
their
culture
,
including
values
,
belief
system
,
rules
,
norms
,
morals
,
language
,
organizations
,
and
institutions
.
While
Material
culture
is
the
physical
evidence
of
a
culture
in
the
objects
and
architecture
they
make
,
or
have
made
.
The
term
tends
to
be
relevant
only
in
archeological
and
anthropological
studies
,
but
it
specifically
means
all
material
evidence
which
can
be
attributed
to
culture
past
or
present
.
Cultural
sociology
first
emerged
in
Weimar
Germany
(
1918
–
1933
)
,
where
sociologists
such
as
Alfred
Weber
used
the
term
Kultursoziologie
(
cultural
sociology
)
.
Cultural
sociology
was
then
"
reinvented
"
in
the
English
-
speaking
world
as
a
product
of
the
"
cultural
turn
"
of
the
1960s
,
which
ushered
in
structuralist
and
postmodern
approaches
to
social
science
.
This
type
of
cultural
sociology
may
loosely
be
regarded
as
an
approach
incorporating
cultural
analysis
and
critical
theory
.
Cultural
sociologists
tend
to
reject
scientific
methods
,
[
citation
needed
]
instead
hermeneutically
focusing
on
words
,
artifacts
and
symbols
.
"
Culture
"
has
since
become
an
important
concept
across
many
branches
of
sociology
,
including
resolutely
scientific
fields
like
social
stratification
and
social
network
analysis
.
As
a
result
,
there
has
been
a
recent
influx
of
quantitative
sociologists
to
the
field
.
Thus
there
is
now
a
growing
group
of
sociologists
of
culture
who
are
,
confusingly
,
not
cultural
sociologists
.
These
scholars
reject
the
abstracted
postmodern
aspects
of
cultural
sociology
,
and
instead
look
for
a
theoretical
backing
in
the
more
scientific
vein
of
social
psychology
and
cognitive
science
.
"
Cultural
sociology
"
is
one
of
the
largest
sections
of
the
American
Sociological
Association
.
The
British
establishment
of
cultural
studies
means
the
latter
is
often
taught
as
a
loosely
distinct
discipline
in
the
UK
.
The
sociology
of
culture
grew
from
the
intersection
between
sociology
(
as
shaped
by
early
theorists
like
Marx
,
Durkheim
,
and
Weber
)
with
the
growing
discipline
of
anthropology
,
where
in
researchers
pioneered
ethnographic
strategies
for
describing
and
analyzing
a
variety
of
cultures
around
the
world
.
Part
of
the
legacy
of
the
early
development
of
the
field
lingers
in
the
methods
(
much
of
cultural
sociological
research
is
qualitative
)
,
in
the
theories
(
a
variety
of
critical
approaches
to
sociology
are
central
to
current
research
communities
)
,
and
in
the
substantive
focus
of
the
field
.
For
instance
,
relationships
between
popular
culture
,
political
control
,
and
social
class
were
early
and
lasting
concerns
in
the
field
.
In
the
United
Kingdom
,
sociologists
and
other
scholars
influenced
by
Marxism
,
such
as
Stuart
Hall
(
1932–2014
)
and
Raymond
Williams
(
1921
–
1988
)
,
developed
cultural
studies
.
Following
nineteenth
-
century
Romantics
,
they
identified
"
culture
"
with
consumption
goods
and
leisure
activities
(
such
as
art
,
music
,
film
,
food
,
sports
,
and
clothing
)
.
Nevertheless
,
they
saw
patterns
of
consumption
and
leisure
as
determined
by
relations
of
production
,
which
led
them
to
focus
on
class
relations
and
the
organization
of
production
.
In
the
United
States
,
"
Cultural
Studies
"
focuses
largely
on
the
study
of
popular
culture
,
that
is
,
on
the
social
meanings
of
mass
-produced
consumer
and
leisure
goods
.
Richard
Hoggart
coined
the
term
in
1964
when
he
founded
the
Birmingham
Centre
for
Contemporary
Cultural
Studies
or
CCCS
.
It
has
since
become
strongly
associated
with
Stuart
Hall
,
who
succeeded
Hoggart
as
Director
.
Cultural
studies
in
this
sense
,
then
,
can
be
viewed
as
a
limited
concentration
scoped
on
the
intricacies
of
consumerism
,
which
belongs
to
a
wider
culture
sometimes
referred
to
as
"
Western
Civilization
"
or
as
"
Globalism
.
"
From
the
1970s
onward
,
Stuart
Hall
's
pioneering
work
,
along
with
that
of
his
colleagues
Paul
Willis
,
Dick
Hebdige
,
Tony
Jefferson
,
and
Angela
McRobbie
,
created
an
international
intellectual
movement
.
As
the
field
developed
it
began
to
combine
political
economy
,
communication
,
sociology
,
social
theory
,
literary
theory
,
media
theory
,
film
/
video
studies
,
cultural
anthropology
,
philosophy
,
museum
studies
and
art
history
to
study
cultural
phenomena
or
cultural
texts
.
In
this
field
researchers
often
concentrate
on
how
particular
phenomena
relate
to
matters
of
ideology
,
nationality
,
ethnicity
,
social
class
,
and
/
or
gender
.

Cultural
studies
has
a
concern
with
the
meaning
and
practices
of
everyday
life
.
These
practices
comprise
the
ways
people
do
particular
things
(
such
as
watching
television
,
or
eating
out
)
in
a
given
culture
.
This
field
studies
the
meanings
and
uses
people
attribute
to
various
objects
and
practices
.
Specifically
,
culture
involves
those
meanings
and
practices
held
independently
of
reason
.
Watching
television
in
order
to
view
a
public
perspective
on
a
historical
event
should
not
be
thought
of
as
culture
,
unless
referring
to
the
medium
of
television
itself
,
which
may
have
been
selected
culturally
;
however
,
schoolchildren
watching
television
after
school
with
their
friends
in
order
to
"
fit
in
"
certainly
qualifies
,
since
there
is
no
grounded
reason
for
one
's
participation
in
this
practice
.
Recently
,
as
capitalism
has
spread
throughout
the
world
(
a
process
called
globalization
)
,
cultural
studies
has
begun
[
when
?
]
to
analyze
local
and
global
forms
of
resistance
to
Western
hegemony
.
[
citation

Globalization
in
this
context
can
be
defined
as
western
civilization
in
other
ways
,
it
undermines
the
cultural
integrity
of
other
culture
and
it
is
therefore
repressive
,
exploitative
and
harmful
to
most
people
in
different
places
.
In
the
context
of
cultural
studies
,
the
idea
of
a
text
includes
not
only
written
language
,
but
also
films
,
photographs
,
fashion
or
hairstyles
:
the
texts
of
cultural
studies
comprise
all
the
meaningful
artifacts
of
culture
.
[

Similarly
,
the
discipline
widens
the
concept
of
"
culture
"
.
"
Culture
"
for
a
cultural
-
studies
researcher
not
only
includes
traditional
high
culture
(
the
culture
of
ruling
social
groups
)
and
popular
culture
,
but
also
everyday
meanings
and
practices
.
The
last
two
,
in
fact
,
have
become
the
main
focus
of
cultural
studies
.
A
further
and
recent
approach
is
comparative
cultural
studies
,
based
on
the
disciplines
of
comparative
literature
and
cultural
studies
.

Scholars
in
the
United
Kingdom
and
the
United
States
developed
somewhat
different
versions
of
cultural
studies
after
the
late
1970s
.
The
British
version
of
cultural
studies
had
originated
in
the
1950s
and
1960s
,
mainly
under
the
influence
first
of
Richard
Hoggart
,
E.
P.
Thompson
,
and
Raymond
Williams
,
and
later
that
of
Stuart
Hall
and
others
at
the
Centre
for
Contemporary
Cultural
Studies
at
the
University
of
Birmingham
.
This
included
overtly
political
,
left-wing
views
,
and
criticisms
of
popular
culture
as
"
capitalist
"
mass
culture
;
it
absorbed
some
of
the
ideas
of
the
Frankfurt
School
critique
of
the
"
culture
industry
"
(
i.e.
mass
culture
)
.
This
emerges
in
the
writings
of
early
British
cultural
-studies
scholars
and
their
influences
:
see
the
work
of
(
for
example
)
Raymond
Williams
,
Stuart
Hall
,
Paul
Willis
,
and
Paul
Gilroy
.
In
the
United
States
,
Lindlof
and
Taylor
write
,
"
Cultural
studies
[
were
]
grounded
in
a
pragmatic
,
liberal
-
pluralist
tradition
"
.
The
American
version
of
cultural
studies
initially
concerned
itself
more
with
understanding
the
subjective
and
appropriative
side
of
audience
reactions
to
,
and
uses
of
,
mass
culture
;
for
example
,
American
cultural
-studies
advocates
wrote
about
the
liberatory
aspects
of
fandom
.

The
distinction
between
American
and
British
strands
,
however
,
has
faded
.

Some
researchers
,
especially
in
early
British
cultural
studies
,
apply
a
Marxist
model
to
the
field
.
This
strain
of
thinking
has
some
influence
from
the
Frankfurt
School
,
but
especially
from
the
structuralist
Marxism
of
Louis
Althusser
and
others
.
The
main
focus
of
an
orthodox
Marxist
approach
concentrates
on
the
production
of
meaning
.
This
model
assumes
a
mass
production
of
culture
and
identifies
power
as
residing
with
those
producing
cultural
artifacts
.
In
a
Marxist
view
,
those
who
control
the
means
of
production
(
the
economic
base
)
essentially
control
a
culture
.
[

Other
approaches
to
cultural
studies
,
such
as
feminist
cultural
studies
and
later
American
developments
of
the
field
,
distance
themselves
from
this
view
.
They
criticize
the
Marxist
assumption
of
a
single
,
dominant
meaning
,
shared
by
all
,
for
any
cultural
product
.
The
non-Marxist
approaches
suggest
that
different
ways
of
consuming
cultural
artifacts
affect
the
meaning
of
the
product
.
This
view
comes
through
in
the
book
Doing
Cultural
Studies
:
The
Story
of
the
Sony
Walkman
(
by
Paul
du
Gay
et
al.
)
,
which
seeks
to
challenge
the
notion
that
those
who
produce
commodities
control
the
meanings
that
people
attribute
to
them
.
Feminist
cultural
analyst
,
theorist
and
art
historian
Griselda
Pollock
contributed
to
cultural
studies
from
viewpoints
of
art
history
and
psychoanalysis
.
The
writer
Julia
Kristeva
is
among
influential
voices
at
the
turn
of
the
century
,
contributing
to
cultural
studies
from
the
field
of
art
and
psychoanalytical
French
feminism

of
the
British
rule
;
and
the
subsequent
independence
movement
that
led
to
the
Partition
of
India
and
the
creation
of
the
Republic
of
India
.
Evidence
of
Anatomically
modern
humans
in
the
Indian
subcontinent
is
recorded
as
long
as
75,000
years
ago
,
or
with
earlier
hominids
including
Homo
erectus
from
about
500,000
years
ago
.
The
Indus
Valley
Civilization
which
spread
and
flourished
in
the
northwestern
part
of
the
Indian
subcontinent
from
c.
3200
to
1300
BCE
,
was
the
first
major
civilization
in
South
Asia
.
A
sophisticated
and
technologically
advanced
urban
culture
developed
in
the
Mature
Harappan
period
,
from
2600
to
1900
BCE
.
This
civilization
collapsed
at
the
start
of
the
second
millennium
BCE
and
was
later
followed
by
the
Iron
Age
Vedic
Civilization
,
which
extended
over
much
of
the
Indo-
Gangetic
plain
and
which
witnessed
the
rise
of
major
polities
known
as
the
Mahajanapadas
.
In
one
of
these
kingdoms
,
Magadha
,
Mahavira
and
Gautama
Buddha
propagated
their
Shramanic
philosophies
during
the
fifth
and
sixth
century
BCE
.
Most
of
the
subcontinent
was
conquered
by
the
Maurya
Empire
during
the
4th
and
3rd
centuries
BCE
.
From
the
3rd
century
BC
onwards
Prakrit
and
Pali
literature
in
the
north
and
the
Sangam
literature
in
southern
India
started
to
flourish
.
Wootz
steel
originated
in
south
India
in
the
3rd
century
BC
and
was
exported
to
foreign
countries
.
Various
parts
of
India
were
ruled
by
numerous
dynasties
for
the
next
1,500
years
,
among
which
the
Gupta
Empire
stands
out
.
This
period
,
witnessing
a
Hindu
religious
and
intellectual
resurgence
,
is
known
as
the
classical
or
"
Golden
Age
of
India
"
.
During
this
period
,
aspects
of
Indian
civilization
,
administration
,
culture
,
and
religion
(
Hinduism
and
Buddhism
)
spread
to
much
of
Asia
,
while
kingdoms
in
southern
India
had
maritime
business
links
with
the
Roman
Empire
from
around
77
CE
.
Indian
cultural
influence
spread
over
many
parts
of
Southeast
Asia
which
led
to
the
establishment
of
Indianized
kingdoms
in
Southeast
Asia
(
Greater
India
)
.
The
most
significant
event
between
the
7th
and
11th
century
was
the
Tripartite
struggle
centered
on
Kannauj
that
lasted
for
more
than
two
centuries
between
the
Pala
Empire
,
Rashtrakuta
Empire
,
and
Gurjara
Pratihara
Empire
.
Southern
India
was
ruled
by
the
Chalukya
,
Chola
,
Pallava
,
Chera
,
Pandyan
,
and
Western
Chalukya
Empires
.
The
seventh
century
also
saw
the
advent
of
Islam
as
a
political
power
,
though
as
a
fringe
,
in
the
western
part
of
the
subcontinent
,
in
modern
-
day
Pakistan
.
The
Chola
dynasty
conquered
southern
India
and
successfully
invaded
parts
of
Southeast
Asia
,
Sri
Lanka
,
Maldives
and
Bengal
in
the
11th
century
.
The
early
medieval
period
Indian
mathematics
influenced
the
development
of
mathematics
and
astronomy
in
the
Arab
world
and
the
Hindu
numerals
were
introduced
.
Muslim
rule
started
in
parts
of
north
India
in
the
13th
century
when
the
Delhi
Sultanate
was
founded
in
1206
CE
by
the
Central
Asian
Turks
.
The
Delhi
Sultanate
ruled
the
major
part
of
northern
India
in
the
early
14th
century
,
but
declined
in
the
late
14th
century
when
several
powerful
Hindu
states
such
as
the
Vijayanagara
Empire
,
Gajapati
Kingdom
,
Ahom
Kingdom
,
as
well
as
Rajput
dynasties
and
states
,
such
as
Mewar
dynasty
,
emerged
.
The
15th
century
saw
the
emergence
of
Sikhism
.
In
the
16th
century
,
Mughals
came
from
Central
Asia
and
gradually
covered
most
of
India
.
The
Mughal
Empire
suffered
a
gradual
decline
in
the
early
18th
century
,
which
provided
opportunities
for
the
Maratha
Empire
,
Sikh
Empire
and
Mysore
Kingdom
to
exercise
control
over
large
areas
of
the
subcontinent
.
From
the
late
18th
century
to
the
mid-19th
century
,
large
areas
of
India
were
annexed
by
the
British
East
India
Company
of
British
Empire
.
Dissatisfaction
with
Company
rule
led
to
the
Indian
Rebellion
of
1857
,
after
which
the
British
provinces
of
India
were
directly
administered
by
the
British
Crown
and
witnessed
a
period
of
both
rapid
development
of
infrastructure
and
economic
stagnation
.
During
the
first
half
of
the
20th
century
,
a
nationwide
struggle
for
independence
was
launched
with
the
leading
party
involved
being
the
Indian
National
Congress
which
was
later
joined
by
other
organizations
.
The
subcontinent
gained
independence
from
the
United
Kingdom
in
1947
,
after
the
British
provinces
were
partitioned
into
the
dominions
of
India
and
Pakistan
and
the
princely
states
all
acceded
to
one
of
the
new
states
.
Romila
Thapar
notes
that
the
division
into
Hindu-Muslim-British
periods
of
Indian
history
gives
too
much
weight
to
"
ruling
dynasties
and
foreign
invasions
"
,
neglecting
the
social
-economic
history
which
often
showed
a
strong
continuity
.
The
division
into
Ancient-Medieval
-Modern
periods
overlooks
the
fact
that
the
Muslim
conquests
occurred
gradually
during
which
time
many
things
came
and
went
off
,
while
the
south
was
never
completely
conquered
.
According
to
Thapar
,
a
periodisation
could
also
be
based
on
"
significant
social
and
economic
changes
"
,
which
are
not
strictly
related
to
a
change
of
ruling
powers
.

Isolated
remains
of
Homo
erectus
in
Hathnora
in
the
Narmada
Valley
in
central
India
indicate
that
India
might
have
been
inhabited
since
at
least
the
Middle
Pleistocene
era
,
somewhere
between
500,000
and
200,000
years
ago
.
Tools

by
proto-humans
that
have
been
dated
back
two
million
years
have
been
discovered
in
the
northwestern
part
of
the
subcontinent
.
The
ancient
history
of
the
region
includes
some
of
South
Asia
's
oldest
settlements
and
some
of
its
major
civilisations
.
The
earliest
archaeological
site
in
the
subcontinent
is
the
palaeolithic
hominid
site
in
the
Soan
River
valley
.
Soanian
sites
are
found
in
the
Sivalik
region
across
what
are
now
India
,
Pakistan
,
and
Nepal
.
The
Mesolithic
period
in
the
Indian
subcontinent
was
followed
by
the
Neolithic
period
,
when
more
extensive
settlement
of
the
subcontinent
occurred
after
the
end
of
the
last
Ice
Age
approximately
12,000
years
ago
.
The
first
confirmed
semipermanent
settlements
appeared
9,000
years
ago
in
the
Bhimbetka
rock
shelters
in
modern
Madhya
Pradesh
,
India
.
Early
Neolithic
culture
in
South
Asia
is
represented
by
the
Bhirrana
findings
(
7500
BCE
)
in
Haryana
,
India
&
Mehrgarh
findings
(
7000
–9000
BCE
)
in
Balochistan
,
Pakistan
.
The
Mature
Indus
civilisation
flourished
from
about
2600
to
1900
BCE
,
marking
the
beginning
of
urban
civilisation
on
the
subcontinent
.
The
civilisation
included
urban
centres
such
as
Dholavira
,
Kalibangan
,
Ropar
,
Rakhigarhi
,
and
Lothal
in
modern-
day
India
,
as
well
as
Harappa
,
Ganeriwala
,
and
Mohenjo
-
daro
in
modern
-
day
Pakistan
.
The
civilisation
is
noted
for
its
cities
built
of
brick
,
roadside
drainage
system
,
and
multistoreyed
houses
and
is
thought
to
have
had
some
kind
of
municipal
organization
.
The
Vedic
period
is
named
after
the
Indo
-
Aryan
culture
of
north-west
India
,
although
other
parts
of
India
had
a
distinct
cultural
identity
during
this
period
.
The
Vedic
culture
is
described
in
the
texts
of
Vedas
,
still
sacred
to
Hindus
,
which
were
orally
composed
in
Vedic
Sanskrit
.
The
Vedas
are
some
of
the
oldest
extant
texts
in
India
.
The
Vedic
period
,
lasting
from
about
1750
to
500
BCE
,
and
contributed
the
foundations
of
several
cultural
aspects
of
Indian
subcontinent
.
In
terms
of
culture
,
many
regions
of
the
subcontinent
transitioned
from
the
Chalcolithic
to
the
Iron
Age
in
this
period
.
At
the
end
of
the
Rigvedic
period
,
the
Aryan
society
began
to
expand
from
the
northwestern
region
of
the
Indian
subcontinent
,
into
the
western
Ganges
plain
.
It
became
increasingly
agricultural
and
was
socially
organised
around
the
hierarchy
of
the
four
varnas
,
or
social
classes
.
This
social
structure
was
characterized
both
by
syncretising
with
the
native
cultures
of
northern
India
,
but
also
eventually
by
the
excluding
of
indigenous
peoples
by
labelling
their
occupations
impure
.
During
this
period
,
many
of
the
previous
small
tribal
units
and
chiefdoms
began
to
coalesce
into
monarchical
,
state
-
level
polities
.
The
Kuru
kingdom
was
the
first
state-level
society
of
the
Vedic
period
,
corresponding
to
the
beginning
of
the
Iron
Age
in
northwestern
India
,
around
1200
–
800
BCE
,
as
well
as
with
the
composition
of
the
Atharvaveda
(
the
first
Indian
text
to
mention
iron
,
as
śyāma
ayas
,
literally
"
black
metal
"
)
.
The
Kuru
state
organized
the
Vedic
hymns
into
collections
,
and
developed
the
orthodox
srauta
ritual
to
uphold
the
social
order
.
When
the
Kuru
kingdom
declined
,
the
center
of
Vedic
culture
shifted
to
their
eastern
neighbours
,
the
Panchala
kingdom
.
The
archaeological
Painted
Grey
Ware
culture
,
which
flourished
in
the
Haryana
and
western
Uttar
Pradesh
regions
of
northern
India
from
about
1100
to
600
BCE
,
is
believed
to
correspond
to
the
Kuru
and
Panchala
kingdoms
.
In
addition
to
the
Vedas
,
the
principal
texts
of
Hinduism
,
the
core
themes
of
the
Sanskrit
epics
Ramayana
and
Mahabharata
are
said
to
have
their
ultimate
origins
during
this
period
.
The
Mahabharata
remains
,
today
,
the
longest
single
poem
in
the
world
.
Historians
formerly
postulated
an
"
epic
age
"
as
the
milieu
of
these
two
epic
poems
,
but
now
recognize
that
the
texts
(
which
are
both
familiar
with
each
other
)
went
through
multiple
stages
of
development
over
centuries
.
For
instance
,
the
Mahabharata
may
have
been
based
on
a
small-scale
conflict
(
possibly
about
1000
BCE
)
which
was
eventually
"
transformed
into
a
gigantic
epic
war
by
bards
and
poets
"
.
There
is
no
conclusive
proof
from
archaeology
as
to
whether
the
specific
events
of
the
Mahabharat
have
any
historical
basis
.
The
existing
texts
of
these
epics
are
believed
to
belong
to
the
post-Vedic
age
,
between
c.
400
BCE
and
400
CE
.
Some
even
attempted
to
date
the
events
using
methods
of
archaeoastronomy
which
have
produced
,
depending
on
which
passages
are
chosen
and
how
they
are
interpreted
,
estimated
dates
ranging
up
to
mid
2nd
millennium
BCE
.
During
the
time
between
800
and
200
BCE
the
Shramana-movement
formed
,
from
which
originated
Jainism
and
Buddhism
.
In
the
same
period
the
first
Upanishads
were
written
.
After
500
BCE
,
the
so-called
"
Second
urbanization
"
started
,
with
new
urban
settlements
arising
at
the
Ganges
plain
,
especially
the
Central
Ganges
plain
.
The
Central
Ganges
Plain
,
where
Magadha
gained
prominence
,
forming
the
base
of
the
Mauryan
Empire
,
was
a
distinct
cultural
area
,
with
new
states
arising
after
500
BC
[

during
the
so-called
"
Second
urbanization
"
.
[

It
was
influenced
by
the
Vedic
culture
,
but
differed
markedly
from
the
Kuru-Panchala
region
.
It
"
was
the
area
of
the
earliest
known
cultivation
of
rice
in
South
Asia
and
by
1800
BC
was
the
location
of
an
advanced
neolithic
population
associated
with
the
sites
of
Chirand
and
Chechar
"
.
In
this
region
the
Shramanic
movements
flourished
,
and
Jainism
and
Buddhism
originated
.
In
the
later
Vedic
Age
,
a
number
of
small
kingdoms
or
city
states
had
covered
the
subcontinent
,
many
mentioned
in
Vedic
,
early
Buddhist
and
Jaina
literature
as
far
back
as
500
BCE
.

Kamboja
—
stretched
across
the
Indo-Gangetic
Plain
from
modern
-
day
Afghanistan
to
Bengal
and
Maharashtra
.
This
period
saw
the
second
major
rise
of
urbanism
in
India
after
the
Indus
Valley
Civilisation
.
Many
smaller
clans
mentioned
within
early
literature
seem
to
have
been
present
across
the
rest
of
the
subcontinent
.
Some
of
these
kings
were
hereditary
;
other
states
elected
their
rulers
.
Early
"
republics
"
such
as
the
Vajji
(
or
Vriji
)
confederation
centered
in
the
city
of
Vaishali
,
existed
as
early
as
the
6th
century
BCE
and
persisted
in
some
areas
until
the
4th
century
CE
.
The
educated
speech
at
that
time
was
Sanskrit
,
while
the
languages
of
the
general
population
of
northern
India
are
referred
to
as
Prakrits
.
Many
of
the
sixteen
kingdoms
had
coalesced
to
four
major
ones
by
500/400
BCE
,
by
the
time
of
Gautama
Buddha
.
These
four
were
Vatsa
,
Avanti
,
Kosala
,
and
Magadha
.
The
Life
of
Gautam
Budhha
was
mainly
associated
with
these
four
kingdoms
.
The
7th
and
6th
centuries
BC
witnessed
the
composition
of
the
earliest
Upanishads
.
Upanishads
form
the
theoretical
basis
of
classical
Hinduism
and
are
known
as
Vedanta
(
conclusion
of
the
Vedas
)
.
The
older
Upanishads
launched
attacks
of
increasing
intensity
on
the
ritual
.
Anyone
who
worships
a
divinity
other
than
the
Self
is
called
a
domestic
animal
of
the
gods
in
the
Brihadaranyaka
Upanishad
.
The
Mundaka
launches
the
most
scathing
attack
on
the
ritual
by
comparing
those
who
value
sacrifice
with
an
unsafe
boat
that
is
endlessly
overtaken
by
old
age
and
death
.
Increasing
urbanisation
of
India
in
7th
and
6th
centuries
BCE
led
to
the
rise
of
new
ascetic
or
shramana
movements
which
challenged
the
orthodoxy
of
rituals
.
Mahavira
(
c.
549–477
BC
)
,
proponent
of
Jainism
,
and
Buddha
(
c.
563-483
)
,
founder
of
Buddhism
were
the
most
prominent
icons
of
this
movement
.
Shramana
gave
rise
to
the
concept
of
the
cycle
of
birth
and
death
,
the
concept
of
samsara
,
and
the
concept
of
liberation
.
Buddha
found
a
Middle
Way
that
ameliorated
the
extreme
asceticism
found
in
the
Sramana
religions
.
Magadha
(
Sanskrit
:
मगध
)
formed
one
of
the
sixteen
Mahā-Janapadas
(
Sanskrit
:
"
Great
Countries
"
)
or
kingdoms
in
ancient
India
.
The
core
of
the
kingdom
was
the
area
of
Bihar
south
of
the
Ganges
;
its
first
capital
was
Rajagriha
(
modern
Rajgir
)
then
Pataliputra
(
modern
Patna
)
.
Magadha
expanded
to
include
most
of
Bihar
and
Bengal
with
the
conquest
of
Licchavi
and
Anga
respectively
,
followed
by
much
of
eastern
Uttar
Pradesh
and
Orissa
.
The
ancient
kingdom
of
Magadha
is
heavily
mentioned
in
Jain
and
Buddhist
texts
.
It
is
also
mentioned
in
the
Ramayana
,
Mahabharata
,
Puranas
.
A
state
of
Magadha
,
possibly
a
tribal
kingdom
,
is
recorded
in
Vedic
texts
much
earlier
in
time
than
600
BC
.
Magadha
Empire
had
great
rulers
like
Bimbisara
and
Ajatshatru
.
The
earliest
reference
to
the
Magadha
people
occurs
in
the
Atharva
-
Veda
where
they
are
found
listed
along
with
the
Angas
,
Gandharis
,
and
Mujavats
.
Magadha
played
an
important
role
in
the
development
of
Jainism
and
Buddhism
,
and
two
of
India
's
greatest
empires
,
the
Maurya
Empire
and
Gupta
Empire
,
originated
from
Magadha
.
These
empires
saw
advancements
in
ancient
India
's
science
,
mathematics
,
astronomy
,
religion
,
and
philosophy
and
were
considered
the
Indian
"
Golden
Age
"
.
The
Magadha
kingdom
included
republican
communities
such
as
the
community
of
Rajakumara
.
Villages
had
their
own
assemblies
under
their
local
chiefs
called
Gramakas
.
Their
administrations
were
divided
into
executive
,
judicial
,
and
military
functions
.
In
530
BC
Cyrus
the
Great
,
King
of
the
Persian
Achaemenid
Empire
crossed
the
Hindu-
Kush
mountains
to
seek
tribute
from
the
tribes
of
Kamboja
,
Gandhara
and
the
trans-India
region
(
modern
Afghanistan
and
Pakistan
)
.
By
520
BC
,
during
the
reign
of
Darius
I
of
Persia
,
much
of
the
northwestern
subcontinent
(
present-
day
eastern
Afghanistan
and
Pakistan
)
came
under
the
rule
of
the
Persian
Achaemenid
Empire
,
as
part
of
the
far
easternmost
territories
.
The
area
remained
under
Persian
control
for
two
centuries
.
During
this
time
India
supplied
mercenaries
to
the
Persian
army
then
fighting
in
Greece
.
By
326
BC
,
Alexander
the
Great
had
conquered
Asia
Minor
and
the
Achaemenid
Empire
and
had
reached
the
northwest
frontiers
of
the
Indian
subcontinent
.
There
he
defeated
King
Porus
in
the
Battle
of
the
Hydaspes
(
near
modern
-
day
Jhelum
,
Pakistan
)
and
conquered
much
of
the
Punjab
.
Alexander
's
march
east
put
him
in
confrontation
with
the
Nanda
Empire
of
Magadha
and
the
Gangaridai
of
Bengal
.
His
army
,
exhausted
and
frightened
by
the
prospect
of
facing
larger
Indian
armies
at
the
Ganges
River
,
mutinied
at
the
Hyphasis
(
modern
Beas
River
)
and
refused
to
march
further
East
.
Alexander
,
after
the
meeting
with
his
officer
,
Coenus
,
and
learning
about
the
might
of
Nanda
Empire
,
was
convinced
that
it
was
better
to
return
.
The
Maurya
Empire
(
322–
185
BCE
)
was
the
first
empire
to
unify
India
into
one
state
,
and
was
the
largest
on
the
Indian
subcontinent
.
At
its
greatest
extent
,
the
Mauryan
Empire
stretched
to
the
north
up
to
the
natural
boundaries
of
the
Himalayas
and
to
the
east
into
what
is
now
Assam
.
To
the
west
,
it
reached
beyond
modern
Pakistan
,
to
the
Hindu
Kush
mountains
in
what
is
now
Afghanistan
.
The
empire
was
established
by
Chandragupta
Maurya
in
Magadha
(
in
modern
Bihar
)
when
he
overthrew
the
Nanda
Dynasty
.
Chandragupta
's
son
Bindusara
succeeded
to
the
throne
around
297
BC
.
By
the
time
he
died
in
c.
272
BC
,
a
large
part
of
the
subcontinent
was
under
Mauryan
suzerainty
.
However
,
the
region
of
Kalinga
(
around
modern
day
Odisha
)
remained
outside
Mauryan
control
,
perhaps
interfering
with
their
trade
with
the
south
.
The
Arthashastra
and
the
Edicts
of
Ashoka
are
the
primary
written
records
of
the
Mauryan
times
.
Archaeologically
,
this
period
falls
into
the
era
of
Northern
Black
Polished
Ware
(
NBPW
)
.
The
Mauryan
Empire
was
based
on
a
modern
and
efficient
economy
and
society
.
However
,
the
sale
of
merchandise
was
closely
regulated
by
the
government
.
Although
there
was
no
banking
in
the
Mauryan
society
,
usury
was
customary
.
A
significant
amount
of
written
records
on
slavery
are
found
,
suggesting
a
prevalence
thereof
.
During
this
period
,
a
high
quality
steel
called
Wootz
steel
was
developed
in
south
India
and
was
later
exported
to
China
and
Arabia
.
During
the
Sangam
period
Tamil
literateure
flourished
from
the
3rd
century
BCE
to
the
4th
century
CE
.
During
this
period
the
3
Tamil
Dynasties
Chera
dynasty
,
Chola
dynasty
and
the
Pandyan
Dynasty
ruled
parts
of
southern
India
.
The
Sangam
literature
deals
with
the
history
,
politics
,
wars
and
culture
of
the
Tamil
people
of
this
period
.
The
scholars
of
the
Sangam
period
rose
from
among
the
common
people
who
sought
the
patronage
of
the
Tamil
Kings
but
who
mainly
wrote
about
the
common
people
and
their
concerns
.
Unlike
Sanskrit
writers
who
were
mostly
Brahmins
,
Sangam
writers
came
from
diverse
classes
and
social
backgrounds
and
were
mostly
non-Brahmins
.
They
belonged
to
different
faiths
and
professions
like
farmers
,
artisans
,
merchants
,
monks
,
priests
and
even
princes
and
quite
few
of
them
were
even
women
.
The
Śātavāhana
Empire
was
a
royal
Indian
dynasty
based
from
Amaravati
in
Andhra
Pradesh
as
well
as
Junnar
(
Pune
)
and
Prathisthan
(
Paithan
)
in
Maharashtra
.
The
territory
of
the
empire
covered
much
of
India
from
230
BCE
onward
.
Sātavāhanas
started
out
as
feudatories
to
the
Mauryan
dynasty
,
but
declared
independence
with
its
decline
.
They
are
known
for
their
patronage
of
Hinduism
and
Buddhism
which
resulted
in
Buddhist
monuments
from
Ellora
(
a
UNESCO
World
Heritage
Site
)
to
Amaravati
.
The
Sātavāhanas
were
one
of
the
first
Indian
states
to
issue
coins
struck
with
their
rulers
embossed
.
They
formed
a
cultural
bridge
and
played
a
vital
role
in
trade
as
well
as
the
transfer
of
ideas
and
culture
to
and
from
the
Indo-Gangetic
Plain
to
the
southern
tip
of
India
.
They
had
to
compete
with
the
Shunga
Empire
and
then
the
Kanva
dynasty
of
Magadha
to
establish
their
rule
.
Later
,
they
played
a
crucial
role
to
protect
a
huge
part
of
India
against
foreign
invaders
like
the
Sakas
,
Yavanas
and
Pahlavas
.
In
particular
their
struggles
with
the
Western
Kshatrapas
went
on
for
a
long
time
.
The
notable
rulers
of
the
Satavahana
Dynasty
Gautamiputra
Satakarni
and
Sri
Yajna
Sātakarni
were
able
to
defeat
the
foreign
invaders
like
the
Western
Kshatrapas
and
to
stop
their
expansion
.
In
the
3rd
century
CE
the
empire
was
split
into
smaller
states
.
The
Shunga
Empire
or
Shunga
Empire
was
an
ancient
Indian
dynasty
from
Magadha
that
controlled
vast
areas
of
the
Indian
subcontinent
from
around
187
to
78
BCE
.
The
dynasty
was
established
by
Pushyamitra
Shunga
,
after
the
fall
of
the
Maurya
Empire
.
Its
capital
was
Pataliputra
,
but
later
emperors
such
as
Bhagabhadra
also
held
court
at
Besnagar
,
modern
Vidisha
in
Eastern
Malwa
.
Pushyamitra
Shunga
ruled
for
36
years
and
was
succeeded
by
his
son
Agnimitra
.
There
were
ten
Shunga
rulers
.
The
empire
is
noted
for
its
numerous
wars
with
both
foreign
and
indigenous
powers
.
They
fought
battles
with
the
Kalingas
,
Satavahanas
,
the
Indo-Greeks
,
and
possibly
the
Panchalas
and
Mathuras
.
Art
,
education
,
philosophy
,
and
other
forms
of
learning
flowered
during
this
period
including
small
terracotta
images
,
larger
stone
sculptures
,
and
architectural
monuments
such
as
the
Stupa
at
Bharhut
,
and
the
renowned
Great
Stupa
at
Sanchi
.
The
Shunga
rulers
helped
to
establish
the
tradition
of
royal
sponsorship
of
learning
and
art
.
The
script
used
by
the
empire
was
a
variant
of
Brahmi
and
was
used
to
write
the
Sanskrit
language
.
The
Shunga
Empire
played
an
imperative
role
in
patronizing
Indian
culture
at
a
time
when
some
of
the
most
important
developments
in
Hindu
thought
were
taking
place
.
During
the
reign
of
Khārabēḷa
,
the
Chedi
dynasty
of
Kaḷinga
ascended
to
eminence
and
restored
the
lost
power
and
glory
of
Kaḷinga
,
which
had
been
subdued
since
the
devastating
war
with
Ashoka
.
Kaḷingan
military
might
was
reinstated
by
Khārabēḷa
:
under
Khārabēḷa
's
generalship
,
the
Kaḷinga
state
had
a
formidable
maritime
reach
with
trade
routes
linking
it
to
the
then
-
Simhala
(
Sri
Lanka
)
,
Burma
(
Myanmar
)
,
Siam
(
Thailand
)
,
Vietnam
,
Kamboja
(
Cambodia
)
,
Malaysia
,
Borneo
,
Bali
,
Samudra
(
Sumatra
)
and
Jabadwipa
(
Java
)
.
Khārabēḷa
led
many
successful
campaigns
against
the
states
of
Magadha
,
Anga
,
Satavahanas
till
the
southern
most
regions
of
Pandyan
Empire
(
modern
Tamil
Nadu
)
.
The
Kushan
Empire
expanded
out
of
what
is
now
Afghanistan
into
the
northwest
of
the
subcontinent
under
the
leadership
of
their
first
emperor
,
Kujula
Kadphises
,
about
the
middle
of
the
1st
century
CE
.
They
came
of
an
Indo-European
language
speaking
Central
Asian
tribe
called
the
Yuezhi
,
a
branch
of
which
was
known
as
the
Kushans
.
By
the
time
of
his
grandson
,
Kanishka
,
they
had
conquered
most
of
northern
India
,
at
least
as
far
as
Saketa
and
Pataliputra
,
in
the
middle
Ganges
Valley
,
and
probably
as
far
as
the
Bay
of
Bengal
.
Classical
India
refers
to
the
period
when
much
of
the
Indian
subcontinent
was
reunited
under
the
Gupta
Empire
(
c.
320–
550
CE
)
.
This
period
has
been
called
the
Golden
Age
of
India
and
was
marked
by
extensive
achievements
in
science
,
technology
,
engineering
,
art
,
dialectic
,
literature
,
logic
,
mathematics
,
astronomy
,
religion
,
and
philosophy
that
crystallized
the
elements
of
what
is
generally
known
as
Hindu
culture
.
The
Hindu-Arabic
numerals
,
a
positional
numeral
system
,
originated
in
India
and
was
later
transmitted
to
the
West
through
the
Arabs
.
Early
Hindu
numerals
had
only
nine
symbols
,
until
600
to
800
CE
,
when
a
symbol
for
zero
was
developed
for
the
numeral
system
.
The
peace
and
prosperity
created
under
leadership
of
Guptas
enabled
the
pursuit
of
scientific
and
artistic
endeavors
in
India
.
The
high
points
of
this
cultural
creativity
are
magnificent
architecture
,
sculpture
,
and
painting
.
The
Gupta
period
produced
scholars
such
as
Kalidasa
,
Aryabhata
,
Varahamihira
,
Vishnu
Sharma
,
and
Vatsyayana
who
made
great
advancements
in
many
academic
fields
.
The
Gupta
period
marked
a
watershed
of
Indian
culture
:
the
Guptas
performed
Vedic
sacrifices
to
legitimize
their
rule
,
but
they
also
patronized
Buddhism
,
which
continued
to
provide
an
alternative
to
Brahmanical
orthodoxy
.
The
military
exploits
of
the
first
three
rulers
–
Chandragupta
I
,
Samudragupta
,
and
Chandragupta
II
-
brought
much
of
India
under
their
leadership
.
Science
and
political
administration
reached
new
heights
during
the
Gupta
era
.
Strong
trade
ties
also
made
the
region
an
important
cultural
centre
and
established
it
as
a
base
that
would
influence
nearby
kingdoms
and
regions
in
Burma
,
Sri
Lanka
,
Maritime
Southeast
Asia
,
and
Indochina
.
For
these
reasons
,
historian
Dr.Barnett
remarked
:
Kadamba
(
345
–
525
CE
)
was
an
ancient
royal
dynasty
of
Karnataka
,
India
that
ruled
northern
Karnataka
and
the
Konkan
from
Banavasi
in
present
-
day
Uttara
Kannada
district
.
At
the
peak
of
their
power
under
King
Kakushtavarma
,
the
Kadambas
of
Banavasi
ruled
large
parts
of
modern
Karnataka
state
.
The
dynasty
was
founded
by
Mayurasharma
in
345
CE
which
at
later
times
showed
the
potential
of
developing
into
imperial
proportions
,
an
indication
to
which
is
provided
by
the
titles
and
epithets
assumed
by
its
rulers
.
King
Mayurasharma
defeated
the
armies
of
Pallavas
of
Kanchi
possibly
with
help
of
some
native
tribes
.
The
Kadamba
fame
reached
its
peak
during
the
rule
of
Kakusthavarma
,
a
notable
ruler
with
whom
even
the
kings
of
Gupta
Dynasty
of
northern
India
cultivated
marital
alliances
.
The
Kadambas
were
contemporaries
of
the
Western
Ganga
Dynasty
and
together
they
formed
the
earliest
native
kingdoms
to
rule
the
land
with
absolute
autonomy
.
The
dynasty
later
continued
to
rule
as
a
feudatory
of
larger
Kannada
empires
,
the
Chalukya
and
the
Rashtrakuta
empires
,
for
over
five
hundred
years
during
which
time
they
branched
into
minor
dynasties
known
as
the
Kadambas
of
Goa
,
Kadambas
of
Halasi
and
Kadambas
of
Hangal
.
The
Hephthalites
(
or
Ephthalites
)
,
also
known
as
the
White
Huns
,
were
a
nomadic
confederation
in
Central
Asia
during
the
late
antiquity
period
.
The
White
Huns
established
themselves
in
modern-
day
Afghanistan
by
the
first
half
of
the
5th
century
.
Led
by
the
Hun
military
leader
Toramana
,
they
overran
the
northern
region
of
Pakistan
and
North
India
.
Toramana
's
son
Mihirakula
,
a
Saivite
Hindu
,
moved
up
to
near
Pataliputra
to
the
east
and
Gwalior
to
the
central
India
.
Hiuen
Tsiang
narrates
Mihirakula
's
merciless
persecution
of
Buddhists
and
destruction
of
monasteries
,
though
the
description
is
disputed
as
far
as
the
authenticity
is
concerned
.
The
Huns
were
defeated
by
the
Indian
kings
Yasodharman
of
Malwa
and
Narasimhagupta
in
the
6th
century
.
Some
of
them
were
driven
out
of
India
and
others
were
assimilated
in
the
Indian
society
.
After
the
downfall
of
the
prior
Gupta
Empire
in
the
middle
of
the
6th
century
,
North
India
reverted
to
small
republics
and
small
monarchical
states
ruled
by
Gupta
rulers
.
Harsha
was
a
convert
to
Buddhism
.
He
united
the
small
republics
from
Punjab
to
central
India
,
and
their
representatives
crowned
Harsha
king
at
an
assembly
in
April
606
giving
him
the
title
of
Maharaja
when
he
was
merely
16
years
old
.
Harsha
belonged
to
Kanojia
.
He
brought
all
of
northern
India
under
his
control
.
The
peace
and
prosperity
that
prevailed
made
his
court
a
center
of
cosmopolitanism
,
attracting
scholars
,
artists
and
religious
visitors
from
far
and
wide
.
The
Chinese
traveler
Xuan
Zang
visited
the
court
of
Harsha
and
wrote
a
very
favorable
account
of
him
,
praising
his
justice
and
generosity
.
From
the
fifth
century
to
the
thirteenth
,
Śrauta
sacrifices
declined
,
and
initiatory
traditions
of
Buddhism
,
Jainism
or
more
commonly
Shaivism
,
Vaishnavism
and
Shaktism
expanded
in
royal
courts
.
This
period
produced
some
of
India
's
finest
art
,
considered
the
epitome
of
classical
development
,
and
the
development
of
the
main
spiritual
and
philosophical
systems
which
continued
to
be
in
Hinduism
,
Buddhism
and
Jainism
.
Emperor
Harsha
of
Kannauj
succeeded
in
reuniting
northern
India
during
his
reign
in
the
7th
century
,
after
the
collapse
of
the
Gupta
dynasty
.
His
empire
collapsed
after
his
death
.
Ronald
Inden
writes
that
by
the
8th
century
CE
symbols
of
Hindu
gods
"
replaced
the
Buddha
at
the
imperial
centre
and
pinnacle
of
the
cosmo-political
system
,
the
image
or
symbol
of
the
Hindu
god
comes
to
be
housed
in
a
monumental
temple
and
given
increasingly
elaborate
imperial
-
style
puja
worship
"
.
Although
Buddhism
did
not
disappear
from
India
for
several
centuries
after
the
eighth
,
royal
proclivities
for
the
cults
of
Vishnu
and
Shiva
weakened
Buddhism
's
position
within
the
sociopolitical
context
and
helped
make
possible
its
decline
.
From
the
8th
to
the
10th
century
,
three
dynasties
contested
for
control
of
northern
India
:
the
Gurjara
Pratiharas
of
Malwa
,
the
Palas
of
Bengal
,
and
the
Rashtrakutas
of
the
Deccan
.
The
Sena
dynasty
would
later
assume
control
of
the
Pala
Empire
,
and
the
Gurjara
Pratiharas
fragmented
into
various
states
.
These
were
the
first
of
the
Rajput
states
.
The
first
recorded
Rajput
kingdoms
emerged
in
Rajasthan
in
the
6th
century
,
and
small
Rajput
dynasties
later
ruled
much
of
northern
India
.
One
Gurjar
Rajput
of
the
Chauhan
clan
,
Prithvi
Raj
Chauhan
,
was
known
for
bloody
conflicts
against
the
advancing
Turkic
sultanates
.
The
Chola
empire
emerged
as
a
major
power
during
the
reign
of
Raja
Raja
Chola
I
and
Rajendra
Chola
I
who
successfully
invaded
parts
of
Southeast
Asia
and
Sri
Lanka
in
the
11th
century
.
Lalitaditya
Muktapida
(
r.
724
CE
–
760
CE
)
was
an
emperor
of
the
Kashmiri
Karkoṭa
dynasty
,
which
exercised
influence
in
northwestern
India
from
625
CE
until
1003
,
and
was
followed
by
Lohara
dynasty
.
He
is
known
primarily
for
his
successful
battles
against
the
Muslim
and
Tibetan
advances
into
Kashmiri-dominated
regions
.
Kalhana
in
his
Rajatarangini
credits
king
Lalitaditya
with
leading
an
aggressive
military
campaign
in
Northern
India
and
Central
Asia
.
He
broke
into
the
Uttarapatha
and
defeated
the
rebellious
tribes
of
the
Kambojas
,
Tukharas
(
Turks
in
Turkmenistan
and
Tocharians
in
Badakhshan
)
,
Bhautas
(
Tibetans
in
Baltistan
and
Tibet
)
and
Daradas
(
Dards
)
.
His
campaign
then
led
him
to
subjugate
the
kingdoms
of
Pragjyotisha
,
Strirajya
and
the
Uttarakurus
.
The
Shahi
dynasty
ruled
portions
of
eastern
Afghanistan
,
northern
Pakistan
,
and
Kashmir
from
the
mid-7th
century
to
the
early
11th
century
.
The
Chalukya
Empire
(
Kannada
:
ಚಾಲುಕ್ಯರು
[
tʃaːɭukjə
]
)
was
an
Indian
royal
dynasty
that
ruled
large
parts
of
southern
and
central
India
between
the
6th
and
the
12th
centuries
.
During
this
period
,
they
ruled
as
three
related
yet
individual
dynasties
.
The
earliest
dynasty
,
known
as
the
"
Badami
Chalukyas
"
,
ruled
from
Vatapi
(
modern
Badami
)
from
the
middle
of
the
6th
century
.
The
Badami
Chalukyas
began
to
assert
their
independence
at
the
decline
of
the
Kadamba
kingdom
of
Banavasi
and
rapidly
rose
to
prominence
during
the
reign
of
Pulakeshin
II
.
The
rule
of
the
Chalukyas
marks
an
important
milestone
in
the
history
of
South
India
and
a
golden
age
in
the
history
of
Karnataka
.
The
political
atmosphere
in
South
India
shifted
from
smaller
kingdoms
to
large
empires
with
the
ascendancy
of
Badami
Chalukyas
.
A
Southern
India-
based
kingdom
took
control
and
consolidated
the
entire
region
between
the
Kaveri
and
the
Narmada
rivers
.
The
rise
of
this
empire
saw
the
birth
of
efficient
administration
,
overseas
trade
and
commerce
and
the
development
of
new
style
of
architecture
called
"
Chalukyan
architecture
"
.
The
Chalukya
dynasty
ruled
parts
of
southern
and
central
India
from
Badami
in
Karnataka
between
550
and
750
,
and
then
again
from
Kalyani
between
970
and
1190
.
Founded
by
Dantidurga
around
753
,
the
Rashtrakuta
Empire
ruled
from
its
capital
at
Manyakheta
for
almost
two
centuries
.
At
its
peak
,
the
Rashtrakutas
ruled
from
the
Ganges
River
and
Yamuna
River
doab
in
the
north
to
Cape
Comorin
in
the
south
,
a
fruitful
time
of
political
expansion
,
architectural
achievements
and
famous
literary
contributions
.

The
early
kings
of
this
dynasty
were
Hindu
but
the
later
kings
were
strongly
influenced
by
Jainism
.
Govinda
III
and
Amoghavarsha
were
the
most
famous
of
the
long
line
of
able
administrators
produced
by
the
dynasty
.
Amoghavarsha
,
who
ruled
for
64
years
,
was
also
an
author
and
wrote
Kavirajamarga
,
the
earliest
known
Kannada
work
on
poetics
.
Architecture
reached
a
milestone
in
the
Dravidian
style
,
the
finest
example
of
which
is
seen
in
the
Kailasanath
Temple
at
Ellora
.
Other
important
contributions
are
the
sculptures
of
Elephanta
Caves
in
modern
Maharashtra
as
well
as
the
Kashivishvanatha
temple
and
the
Jain
Narayana
temple
at
Pattadakal
in
modern
Karnataka
,
all
of
which
are
UNESCO
World
Heritage
Sites
.
The
Arab
traveler
Suleiman
described
the
Rashtrakuta
Empire
as
one
of
the
four
great
Empires
of
the
world
.
The
Rashtrakuta
period
marked
the
beginning
of
the
golden
age
of
southern
Indian
mathematics
.
The
great
south
Indian
mathematician
Mahāvīra
(
mathematician
)
lived
in
the
Rashtrakuta
Empire
and
his
text
had
a
huge
impact
on
the
medieval
south
Indian
mathematicians
who
lived
after
him
.
The
Rashtrakuta
rulers
also
patronised
men
of
letters
,
who
wrote
in
a
variety
of
languages
from
Sanskrit
to
the
Apabhraṃśas
.
The
Pala
Empire
(
Bengali
:
পাল
সাম্রাজ্য
Pal
Samrajyô
)
flourished
during
the
Classical
period
of
India
,
and
may
be
dated
during
750
–
1174
CE
.
Founded
by
Gopala
I
,
it
was
ruled
by
a
Buddhist
dynasty
from
Bengal
in
the
eastern
region
of
the
Indian
subcontinent
.
Though
the
Palas
were
followers
of
the
Mahayana
and
Tantric
schools
of
Buddhism
,
they
also
patronised
Shaivism
and
Vaishnavism
.
The
morpheme
Pala
,
meaning
"
protector
"
,
was
used
as
an
ending
for
the
names
of
all
the
Pala
monarchs
.
The
empire
reached
its
peak
under
Dharmapala
and
Devapala
.
Dharmapala
is
believed
to
have
conquered
Kanauj
and
extended
his
sway
up
to
the
farthest
limits
of
India
in
the
northwest
.
The
Pala
Empire
can
be
considered
as
the
golden
era
of
Bengal
in
many
ways
.
Dharmapala
founded
the
Vikramashila
and
revived
Nalanda
,
considered
one
of
the
first
great
universities
in
recorded
history
.
Nalanda
reached
its
height
under
the
patronage
of
the
Pala
Empire
.
The
Palas
also
built
many
viharas
.
They
maintained
close
cultural
and
commercial
ties
with
countries
of
Southeast
Asia
and
Tibet
.
Sea
trade
added
greatly
to
the
prosperity
of
the
Pala
kingdom
.
The
Arab
merchant
Suleiman
notes
the
enormity
of
the
Pala
army
in
his
memoirs
.
Medieval
Cholas
rose
to
prominence
during
the
middle
of
the
9th
century
C.E.
and
established
the
greatest
empire
South
India
had
seen
.
They
successfully
united
the
South
India
under
their
rule
and
through
their
naval
strength
extended
their
influence
in
the
Southeast
Asian
countries
such
as
Srivijaya
.
Under
Rajaraja
Chola
I
and
his
successors
Rajendra
Chola
I
,
Rajadhiraja
Chola
,
Virarajendra
Chola
and
Kulothunga
Chola
I
the
dynasty
became
a
military
,
economic
and
cultural
power
in
South
Asia
and
South
-
East
Asia
.
Rajendra
Chola
I
's
navies
went
even
further
,
occupying
the
sea
coasts
from
Burma
to
Vietnam
,
the
Andaman
and
Nicobar
Islands
,
the
Lakshadweep
(
Laccadive
)
islands
,
Sumatra
,
and
the
Malay
Peninsula
in
Southeast
Asia
and
the
Pegu
islands
.
The
power
of
the
new
empire
was
proclaimed
to
the
eastern
world
by
the
expedition
to
the
Ganges
which
Rajendra
Chola
I
undertook
and
by
the
occupation
of
cities
of
the
maritime
empire
of
Srivijaya
in
Southeast
Asia
,
as
well
as
by
the
repeated
embassies
to
China
.
They
dominated
the
political
affairs
of
Sri
Lanka
for
over
two
centuries
through
repeated
invasions
and
occupation
.
They
also
had
continuing
trade
contacts
with
the
Arabs
in
the
west
and
with
the
Chinese
empire
in
the
east
.
Rajaraja
Chola
I
and
his
equally
distinguished
son
Rajendra
Chola
I
gave
political
unity
to
the
whole
of
Southern
India
and
established
the
Chola
Empire
as
a
respected
sea
power
.
Under
the
Cholas
,
the
South
India
reached
new
heights
of
excellence
in
art
,
religion
and
literature
.
In
all
of
these
spheres
,
the
Chola
period
marked
the
culmination
of
movements
that
had
begun
in
an
earlier
age
under
the
Pallavas
.
Monumental
architecture
in
the
form
of
majestic
temples
and
sculpture
in
stone
and
bronze
reached
a
finesse
never
before
achieved
in
India
.
The
Western
Chalukya
Empire
(
Kannada:
ಪಶ್ಚಿಮ
ಚಾಲುಕ್ಯ
ಸಾಮ್ರಾಜ್ಯ
)
ruled
most
of
the
western
Deccan
,
South
India
,
between
the
10th
and
12th
centuries
.
Vast
areas
between
the
Narmada
River
in
the
north
and
Kaveri
River
in
the
south
came
under
Chalukya
control
.
During
this
period
the
other
major
ruling
families
of
the
Deccan
,
the
Hoysalas
,
the
Seuna
Yadavas
of
Devagiri
,
the
Kakatiya
dynasty
and
the
Southern
Kalachuri
,
were
subordinates
of
the
Western
Chalukyas
and
gained
their
independence
only
when
the
power
of
the
Chalukya
waned
during
the
later
half
of
the
12th
century
.
The
Western
Chalukyas
developed
an
architectural
style
known
today
as
a
transitional
style
,
an
architectural
link
between
the
style
of
the
early
Chalukya
dynasty
and
that
of
the
later
Hoysala
empire
.
Most
of
its
monuments
are
in
the
districts
bordering
the
Tungabhadra
River
in
central
Karnataka
.
Well
known
examples
are
the
Kasivisvesvara
Temple
at
Lakkundi
,
the
Mallikarjuna
Temple
at
Kuruvatti
,
the
Kallesvara
Temple
at
Bagali
and
the
Mahadeva
Temple
at
Itagi
.
This
was
an
important
period
in
the
development
of
fine
arts
in
Southern
India
,
especially
in
literature
as
the
Western
Chalukya
kings
encouraged
writers
in
the
native
language
of
Kannada
,
and
Sanskrit
like
the
philosopher
and
statesman
Basava
and
the
great
mathematician
Bhāskara
II
.
The
early
Islamic
literature
indicates
that
the
conquest
of
India
was
one
of
the
very
early
ambitions
of
the
Muslims
,
though
it
was
recognized
as
a
particularly
difficult
one
.
After
conquering
Persia
,
the
Arab
Umayyad
Caliphate
incorporated
parts
of
what
are
now
Afghanistan
and
Pakistan
around
720
.
The
book
Chach
Nama
chronicles
the
Chacha
Dynasty
's
period
,
following
the
demise
of
the
Rai
Dynasty
and
the
ascent
of
Chach
of
Alor
to
the
throne
,
down
to
the
Arab
conquest
by
Muhammad
bin
Qasim
in
the
early
8th
century
AD
,
by
defeating
the
last
Hindu
monarch
of
Sindh
,
Raja
Dahir
.
In
712
,
Arab
Muslim
general
Muhammad
bin
Qasim
conquered
most
of
the
Indus
region
in
modern-
day
Pakistan
for
the
Umayyad
Empire
,
incorporating
it
as
the
"
As
-
Sindh
"
province
with
its
capital
at
Al
-
Mansurah
,
72
km
(
45
mi
)
north
of
modern
Hyderabad
in
Sindh
,
Pakistan
.
After
several
incursions
,
the
Hindu
kings
east
of
Indus
defeated
the
Arabs
at
the
Battle
of
Rajasthan
,
halting
their
expansion
and
containing
them
at
Sindh
in
Pakistan
.
The
south
Indian
Chalukya
empire
under
Vikramaditya
II
,
Nagabhata
I
of
the
Pratihara
dynasty
and
Bappa
Rawal
of
the
Guhilot
dynasty
repulsed
the
Arab
invaders
in
the
early
8th
century
.
Several
Islamic
kingdoms
(
sultanates
)
under
both
foreign
and
,
newly
converted
,
Rajput
rulers
were
established
across
the
north
western
subcontinent
(
Afghanistan
and
Pakistan
)
over
a
period
of
a
few
centuries
.
From
the
10th
century
,
Sindh
was
ruled
by
the
Rajput
Soomra
dynasty
,
and
later
,
in
the
mid-13th
century
by
the
Rajput
Samma
dynasty
.
Additionally
,
Muslim
trading
communities
flourished
throughout
coastal
south
India
,
particularly
on
the
western
coast
where
Muslim
traders
arrived
in
small
numbers
,
mainly
from
the
Arabian
peninsula
.
This
marked
the
introduction
of
a
third
Abrahamic
Middle
Eastern
religion
,
following
Judaism
and
Christianity
,
often
in
puritanical
form
.
Mahmud
of
Ghazni
in
the
early
11th
century
raided
mainly
the
north-western
parts
of
the
Indian
sub-continent
17
times
,
but
he
did
not
seek
to
establish
"
permanent
dominion
"
in
those
areas
.
The
Kabul
Shahi
dynasties
ruled
the
Kabul
Valley
and
Gandhara
(
modern
-
day
Pakistan
and
Afghanistan
)
from
the
decline
of
the
Kushan
Empire
in
the
3rd
century
to
the
early
9th
century
.
The
Shahis
are
generally
split
up
into
two
eras
:
the
Buddhist
Shahis
and
the
Hindu
Shahis
,
with
the
change-
over
thought
to
have
occurred
sometime
around
870
.
The
kingdom
was
known
as
the
Kabul
Shahan
or
Ratbelshahan
from
565
-
670
,
when
the
capitals
were
located
in
Kapisa
and
Kabul
,
and
later
Udabhandapura
,
also
known
as
Hund
for
its
new
capital
.
The
Hindu
Shahis
under
Jayapala
,
is
known
for
his
struggles
in
defending
his
kingdom
against
the
Ghaznavids
in
the
modern
-
day
eastern
Afghanistan
and
Pakistan
region
.
Jayapala
saw
a
danger
in
the
consolidation
of
the
Ghaznavids
and
invaded
their
capital
city
of
Ghazni
both
in
the
reign
of
Sebuktigin
and
in
that
of
his
son
Mahmud
,
which
initiated
the
Muslim
Ghaznavid
and
Hindu
Shahi
struggles
.
Sebuk
Tigin
,
however
,
defeated
him
,
and
he
was
forced
to
pay
an
indemnity
.
Jayapala
defaulted
on
the
payment
and
took
to
the
battlefield
once
more
.
Jayapala
however
,
lost
control
of
the
entire
region
between
the
Kabul
Valley
and
Indus
River
.
However
,
the
army
was
hopeless
in
battle
against
the
western
forces
,
particularly
against
the
young
Mahmud
of
Ghazni
.
In
the
year
1001
,
soon
after
Sultan
Mahmud
came
to
power
and
was
occupied
with
the
Qarakhanids
north
of
the
Hindu
Kush
,
Jaipal
attacked
Ghazni
once
more
and
upon
suffering
yet
another
defeat
by
the
powerful
Ghaznavid
forces
,
near
present
-
day
Peshawar
.
After
the
Battle
of
Peshawar
,
he
committed
suicide
because
his
subjects
thought
he
had
brought
disaster
and
disgrace
to
the
Shahi
dynasty
.
Like
other
settled
,
agrarian
societies
in
history
,
those
in
the
Indian
subcontinent
have
been
attacked
by
nomadic
tribes
throughout
its
long
history
.
In
evaluating
the
impact
of
Islam
on
the
sub-continent
,
one
must
note
that
the
northwestern
sub-continent
was
a
frequent
target
of
tribes
raiding
from
Central
Asia
.
In
that
sense
,
the
Muslim
intrusions
and
later
Muslim
invasions
were
not
dissimilar
to
those
of
the
earlier
invasions
during
the
1st
millennium
.
What
does
however
,
make
the
Muslim
intrusions
and
later
Muslim
invasions
different
is
that
unlike
the
preceding
invaders
who
assimilated
into
the
prevalent
social
system
,
the
successful
Muslim
conquerors
retained
their
Islamic
identity
and
created
new
legal
and
administrative
systems
that
challenged
and
usually
in
many
cases
superseded
the
existing
systems
of
social
conduct
and
ethics
,
even
influencing
the
non-Muslim
rivals
and
common
masses
to
a
large
extent
,
though
non-Muslim
population
was
left
to
their
own
laws
and
customs
.
They
also
introduced
new
cultural
codes
that
in
some
ways
were
very
different
from
the
existing
cultural
codes
.
This
led
to
the
rise
of
a
new
Indian
culture
which
was
mixed
in
nature
,
though
different
from
both
the
ancient
Indian
culture
and
later
westernized
modern
Indian
culture
.
At
the
same
time
it
must
be
noted
that
overwhelming
majority
of
Muslims
in
India
are
Indian
natives
converted
to
Islam
.
This
factor
also
played
an
important
role
in
the
synthesis
of
cultures
.
The
subsequent
Slave
dynasty
of
Delhi
managed
to
conquer
large
areas
of
northern
India
,
while
the
Khilji
dynasty
conquered
most
of
central
India
but
were
ultimately
unsuccessful
in
conquering
and
uniting
the
subcontinent
.
The
Sultanate
ushered
in
a
period
of
Indian
cultural
renaissance
.
The
resulting
"
Indo-
Muslim
"
fusion
of
cultures
left
lasting
syncretic
monuments
in
architecture
,
music
,
literature
,
religion
,
and
clothing
.
It
is
surmised
that
the
language
of
Urdu
(
literally
meaning
"
horde
"
or
"
camp
"
in
various
Turkic
dialects
)
was
born
during
the
Delhi
Sultanate
period
as
a
result
of
the
intermingling
of
the
local
speakers
of
Sanskritic
Prakrits
with
immigrants
speaking
Persian
,
Turkic
,
and
Arabic
under
the
Muslim
rulers
.
The
Delhi
Sultanate
is
the
only
Indo-Islamic
empire
to
enthrone
one
of
the
few
female
rulers
in
India
,
Razia
Sultana
(
1236
–
1240
)
.
A
Turco-Mongol
conqueror
in
Central
Asia
,
Timur
(
Tamerlane
)
,
attacked
the
reigning
Sultan
Nasir-u
Din
Mehmud
of
the
Tughlaq
Dynasty
in
the
north
Indian
city
of
Delhi
.
The
Sultan
's
army
was
defeated
on
17
December
1398
.
Timur
entered
Delhi
and
the
city
was
sacked
,
destroyed
,
and
left
in
ruins
,
after
Timur
's
army
had
killed
and
plundered
for
three
days
and
nights
.
He
ordered
the
whole
city
to
be
sacked
except
for
the
sayyids
,
scholars
,
and
the
"
other
Muslims
"
(
artists
)
;
100,000
war
prisoners
were
put
to
death
in
one
day
.
The
Sultanate
suffered
significantly
from
the
sacking
of
Delhi
revived
briefly
under
the
Lodi
Dynasty
,
but
it
was
a
shadow
of
the
former
.
The
Empire
was
established
in
1336
by
Harihara
I
and
his
brother
Bukka
Raya
I
of
Sangama
Dynasty
.
The
empire
rose
to
prominence
as
a
culmination
of
attempts
by
the
southern
powers
to
ward
off
Islamic
invasions
by
the
end
of
the
13th
century
.
The
empire
is
named
after
its
capital
city
of
Vijayanagara
,
whose
ruins
surround
present
day
Hampi
,
now
a
World
Heritage
Site
in
Karnataka
,
India
.
The
empire
's
legacy
includes
many
monuments
spread
over
South
India
,
the
best
known
of
which
is
the
group
at
Hampi
.
The
previous
temple
building
traditions
in
South
India
came
together
in
the
Vijayanagara
Architecture
style
.
The
mingling
of
all
faiths
and
vernaculars
inspired
architectural
innovation
of
Hindu
temple
construction
,
first
in
the
Deccan
and
later
in
the
Dravidian
idioms
using
the
local
granite
.
South
Indian
mathematics
flourished
under
the
protection
of
the
Vijayanagara
Empire
in
Kerala
.
The
south
Indian
mathematician
Madhava
of
Sangamagrama
founded
the
famous
Kerala
school
of
astronomy
and
mathematics
in
the
14th
century
which
produced
a
lot
of
great
south
Indian
mathematicians
like
Parameshvara
,
Nilakantha
Somayaji
and
Jyeṣṭhadeva
in
medieval
south
India
.
Efficient
administration
and
vigorous
overseas
trade
brought
new
technologies
such
as
water
management
systems
for
irrigation
.
The
empire
's
patronage
enabled
fine
arts
and
literature
to
reach
new
heights
in
Kannada
,
Telugu
,
Tamil
and
Sanskrit
,
while
Carnatic
music
evolved
into
its
current
form
.
The
Vijayanagara
Empire
created
an
epoch
in
South
Indian
history
that
transcended
regionalism
by
promoting
Hinduism
as
a
unifying
factor
.
The
empire
reached
its
peak
during
the
rule
of
Sri
Krishnadevaraya
when
Vijayanagara
armies
were
consistently
victorious
.
The
empire
annexed
areas
formerly
under
the
Sultanates
in
the
northern
Deccan
and
the
territories
in
the
eastern
Deccan
,
including
Kalinga
,
while
simultaneously
maintaining
control
over
all
its
subordinates
in
the
south
.
Many
important
monuments
were
either
completed
or
commissioned
during
the
time
of
Krishna
Deva
Raya
.
Vijayanagara
went
into
decline
after
the
defeat
in
the
Battle
of
Talikota
(
1565
)
.
For
two
and
a
half
centuries
from
the
mid
13th
,
the
politics
in
the
Northern
India
was
dominated
by
the
Delhi
Sultanate
and
in
the
Southern
India
by
the
Vijayanagar
Empire
which
originated
as
a
political
heir
of
the
erstwhile
Hoysala
Empire
and
Pandyan
Empire
.
However
,
there
were
other
regional
powers
present
as
well
.
In
the
North
,
the
Rajputs
were
a
dominant
force
in
the
Western
and
Central
India
.
Their
power
reached
to
the
zenith
under
Rana
Sanga
during
whose
time
Rajput
armies
were
constantly
victorious
against
the
Sultanate
army
.
In
the
South
,
the
Bahmani
Sultanate
was
the
chief
rival
of
the
Vijaynagara
and
gave
Vijayanagara
tough
days
many
a
times
.
In
the
early
16th
century
Krishnadevaraya
of
the
Vijayanagara
Empire
defeated
the
last
remnant
of
Bahmani
Sultanate
power
after
which
the
Bahmani
Sultanate
collapsed
.
It
was
established
either
by
a
Brahman
convert
or
patronized
by
a
Brahman
and
form
that
source
it
got
the
name
Bahmani
.
In
the
early
16th
century
,
it
collapsed
and
got
split
into
five
small
Deccan
sultanates
.
In
the
East
,
the
Gajapati
Kingdom
remained
a
strong
regional
power
to
reckon
with
,
so
was
the
Ahom
Kingdom
in
the
North
-
east
for
six
centuries
.
Ahom
Kingdom
(
1228
–
1826
)
was
a
kingdom
and
tribe
which
rose
to
prominence
in
present
-
day
Assam
early
in
the
thirteenth
century
.
They
ruled
much
of
Assam
from
the
13th
century
until
the
establishment
of
British
rule
in
1838
.
The
Ahoms
brought
with
them
a
tribal
religion
and
a
language
of
their
own
,
however
they
later
merged
with
the
Hindu
religion
.
From
thirteenth
till
seventeenth
century
,
repeated
attempts
were
made
by
the
Muslim
rulers
of
Delhi
to
invade
and
subdue
Ahoms
,
however
the
Ahoms
managed
to
maintain
their
independence
and
ruled
themselves
for
nearly
600
years
.
In
1526
,
Babur
,
a
Timurid
descendant
of
Timur
and
Genghis
Khan
from
Fergana
Valley
(
modern
day
Uzbekistan
)
,
swept
across
the
Khyber
Pass
and
established
the
Mughal
Empire
,
which
at
its
zenith
covered
modern
day
Afghanistan
,
Pakistan
,
India
and
Bangladesh
.
However
,
his
son
Humayun
was
defeated
by
the
Afghan
warrior
Sher
Shah
Suri
in
the
year
1540
,
and
Humayun
was
forced
to
retreat
to
Kabul
.
After
Sher
Shah
's
death
,
his
son
Islam
Shah
Suri
and
the
Hindu
emperor
Hemu
Vikramaditya
,
who
had
won
22
battles
against
Afghan
rebels
and
forces
of
Akbar
,
from
Punjab
to
Bengal
and
had
established
a
secular
rule
in
North
India
from
Delhi
till
1556
after
winning
Battle
of
Delhi
.
Akbar
's
forces
defeated
and
killed
Hemu
in
the
Second
Battle
of
Panipat
on
6
November
1556
.
Akbar
's
son
,
Jahangir
more
or
less
followed
father
's
policy
.
The
Mughal
dynasty
ruled
most
of
the
Indian
subcontinent
by
1600
.
The
reign
of
Shah
Jahan
was
the
golden
age
of
Mughal
architecture
.
He
erected
several
large
monuments
,
the
most
famous
of
which
is
the
Taj
Mahal
at
Agra
,
as
well
as
the
Moti
Masjid
,
Agra
,
the
Red
Fort
,
the
Jama
Masjid
,
Delhi
,
and
the
Lahore
Fort
.
The
Mughal
Empire
reached
the
zenith
of
its
territorial
expanse
during
the
reign
of
Aurangzeb
and
also
started
its
terminal
decline
in
his
reign
due
to
Maratha
military
resurgence
under
Shivaji
.
Historian
Sir.
J.N.
Sarkar
wrote
,
"
All
seemed
to
have
been
gained
by
Aurangzeb
now
,
but
in
reality
all
was
lost
.
"
The
same
was
echoed
by
Vincent
Smith
:
"
The
Deccan
proved
to
be
the
graveyard
not
only
of
Aurangzeb
's
body
but
also
of
his
empire
"
.
The
empire
went
into
decline
thereafter
.
The
Mughals
suffered
several
blows
due
to
invasions
from
Marathas
and
Afghans
.
During
the
decline
of
the
Mughal
Empire
,
several
smaller
states
rose
to
fill
the
power
vacuum
and
themselves
were
contributing
factors
to
the
decline
.
In
1737
,
the
Maratha
general
Bajirao
of
the
Maratha
Empire
invaded
and
plundered
Delhi
.
Under
the
general
Amir
Khan
Umrao
Al
Udat
,
the
Mughal
Emperor
sent
8,000
troops
to
drive
away
the
5,000
Maratha
cavalry
soldiers
.
Baji
Rao
,
however
,
easily
routed
the
novice
Mughal
general
and
the
rest
of
the
imperial
Mughal
army
fled
.
In
1737
,
in
the
final
defeat
of
Mughal
Empire
,
the
commander
-
in-chief
of
the
Mughal
Army
,
Nizam-ul-
mulk
,
was
routed
at
Bhopal
by
the
Maratha
army
.
This
essentially
brought
an
end
to
the
Mughal
Empire
.
In
1739
,
Nader
Shah
,
emperor
of
Iran
,
defeated
the
Mughal
army
at
the
Battle
of
Karnal
.
After
this
victory
,
Nader
captured
and
sacked
Delhi
,
carrying
away
many
treasures
,
including
the
Peacock
Throne
.
The
Mughal
dynasty
was
reduced
to
puppet
rulers
by
1757
.
The
remnants
of
the
Mughal
dynasty
were
finally
defeated
during
the
Indian
Rebellion
of
1857
,
also
called
the
1857
War
of
Independence
,
and
the
remains
of
the
empire
were
formally
taken
over
by
the
British
while
the
Government
of
India
Act
1858
let
the
British
Crown
assume
direct
control
of
India
in
the
form
of
the
new
British
Raj
.
The
Mughals
were
perhaps
the
richest
single
dynasty
to
have
ever
existed
.
During
the
Mughal
era
,
the
dominant
political
forces
consisted
of
the
Mughal
Empire
and
its
tributaries
and
,
later
on
,
the
rising
successor
states
–
including
the
Maratha
Empire
–
which
fought
an
increasingly
weak
Mughal
dynasty
.
The
Mughals
,
while
often
employing
brutal
tactics
to
subjugate
their
empire
,
had
a
policy
of
integration
with
Indian
culture
,
which
is
what
made
them
successful
where
the
short-
lived
Sultanates
of
Delhi
had
failed
.
This
period
marked
vast
social
change
in
the
subcontinent
as
the
Hindu
majority
were
ruled
over
by
the
Mughal
emperors
,
most
of
whom
showed
religious
tolerance
,
liberally
patronising
Hindu
culture
.
The
famous
emperor
Akbar
,
who
was
the
grandson
of
Babar
,
tried
to
establish
a
good
relationship
with
the
Hindus
.
However
,
later
emperors
such
as
Aurangazeb
tried
to
establish
complete
Muslim
dominance
,
and
as
a
result
several
historical
temples
were
destroyed
during
this
period
and
taxes
imposed
on
non-Muslims
.
Akbar
declared
"
Amari
"
or
non-killing
of
animals
in
the
holy
days
of
Jainism
.
He
rolled
back
the
jizya
tax
for
non-Muslims
.
The
Mughal
emperors
married
local
royalty
,
allied
themselves
with
local
maharajas
,
and
attempted
to
fuse
their
Turko-
Persian
culture
with
ancient
Indian
styles
,
creating
a
unique
Indo-Saracenic
architecture
.
It
was
the
erosion
of
this
tradition
coupled
with
increased
brutality
and
centralization
that
played
a
large
part
in
the
dynasty
's
downfall
after
Aurangzeb
,
who
unlike
previous
emperors
,
imposed
relatively
non-pluralistic
policies
on
the
general
population
,
which
often
inflamed
the
majority
Hindu
population
.
The
post
-
Mughal
era
was
dominated
by
the
rise
of
the
Maratha
suzerainty
as
other
small
regional
states
(
mostly
late
Mughal
tributary
states
)
emerged
,
and
also
by
the
increasing
activities
of
European
powers
.
There
is
no
doubt
that
the
single
most
important
power
to
emerge
in
the
long
twilight
of
the
Mughal
dynasty
was
the
Maratha
confederacy
.
The
Maratha
kingdom
was
founded
and
consolidated
by
Chatrapati
Shivaji
,
a
Maratha
aristocrat
of
the
Bhonsle
clan
who
was
determined
to
establish
Hindavi
Swarajya
.
Sir
J.N.
Sarkar
described
Shivaji
as
"
the
last
great
constructive
genius
and
nation
builder
that
the
Hindu
race
has
produced
"
.
However
,
the
credit
for
making
the
Marathas
formidable
power
nationally
goes
to
Peshwa
Bajirao
I.
Historian
K.K.
Datta
wrote
about
Bajirao
I
:
By
the
early
18th
century
,
the
Maratha
Kingdom
had
transformed
itself
into
the
Maratha
Empire
under
the
rule
of
the
Peshwas
(
prime
ministers
)
.
In
1737
,
the
Marathas
defeated
a
Mughal
army
in
their
capital
,
Delhi
itself
in
Battle
of
Delhi
(
1737
)
.
The
Marathas
continued
their
military
campaigns
against
Mughals
,
Nizam
,
Nawab
of
Bengal
and
Durrani
Empire
to
further
extend
their
boundaries
.
Gordon
explained
how
the
Maratha
systematically
took
control
over
new
regions
.
They
would
start
with
annual
raids
,
followed
by
collecting
ransom
from
villages
and
towns
while
the
declining
Mughal
Empire
retained
nominal
control
and
finally
taking
over
the
region
.
He
explained
it
with
the
example
of
Malwa
region
.
Marathas
built
an
efficient
system
of
public
administration
known
for
its
attention
to
detail
.
It
succeeded
in
raising
revenue
in
districts
that
recovered
from
years
of
raids
,
up
to
levels
previously
enjoyed
by
the
Mughals
.
For
example
,
the
cornerstone
of
the
Maratha
rule
in
Malwa
rested
on
the
60
or
so
local
tax
collectors
who
advanced
the
Maratha
ruler
Peshwa
a
portion
of
their
district
revenues
at
interest
.
By
1760
,
the
domain
of
the
Marathas
stretched
across
practically
the
entire
subcontinent
.
The
north-western
expansion
of
the
Marathas
was
stopped
after
the
Third
Battle
of
Panipat
(
1761
)
.
However
,
the
Maratha
authority
in
the
north
was
re-established
within
a
decade
under
Peshwa
Madhavrao
I
.
The
defeat
of
Marathas
by
British
in
third
Anglo-
Maratha
Wars
brought
end
to
the
empire
by
1820
.
The
last
peshwa
,
Baji
Rao
II
,
was
defeated
by
the
British
in
the
Third
Anglo
-
Maratha
War
.
With
the
defeat
of
the
Marathas
,
no
native
power
represented
any
significant
threat
for
the
British
afterwards
.
The
Punjabi
kingdom
,
ruled
by
members
of
the
Sikh
religion
,
was
a
political
entity
that
governed
the
region
of
modern-
day
Punjab
.
The
empire
,
based
around
the
Punjab
region
,
existed
from
1799
to
1849
.
It
was
forged
,
on
the
foundations
of
the
Khalsa
,
under
the
leadership
of
Maharaja
Ranjit
Singh
(
1780
–
1839
)
from
an
array
of
autonomous
Punjabi
Misls
.
He
consolidated
many
parts
of
northern
India
into
a
kingdom
.
He
primarily
used
his
highly
disciplined
Sikh
army
that
he
trained
and
equipped
to
be
the
equal
of
a
European
force
.
Ranjit
Singh
proved
himself
to
be
a
master
strategist
and
selected
well
qualified
generals
for
his
army
.
In
stages
,
he
added
the
central
Punjab
,
the
provinces
of
Multan
and
Kashmir
,
the
Peshawar
Valley
,
and
the
Derajat
to
his
kingdom
.
This
came
in
the
face
of
the
powerful
British
East
India
Company
.
At
its
peak
,
in
the
19th
century
,
the
empire
extended
from
the
Khyber
Pass
in
the
west
,
to
Kashmir
in
the
north
,
to
Sindh
in
the
south
,
running
along
Sutlej
river
to
Himachal
in
the
east
.
This
was
among
the
last
areas
of
the
subcontinent
to
be
conquered
by
the
British
.
The
first
Anglo
-
Sikh
war
and
second
Anglo
-
Sikh
war
marked
the
downfall
of
the
Sikh
Empire
.
There
were
several
other
kingdoms
which
ruled
over
parts
of
India
in
the
later
medieval
period
prior
to
the
British
occupation
.
However
,
most
of
them
were
bound
to
pay
regular
tribute
to
the
Marathas
.
The
rule
of
Wodeyar
dynasty
which
established
the
Kingdom
of
Mysore
in
southern
India
in
around
1400
CE
by
was
interrupted
by
Hyder
Ali
and
his
son
Tipu
Sultan
in
the
later
half
of
the
18th
century
.
Under
their
rule
,
Mysore
fought
a
series
of
wars
sometimes
against
the
combined
forces
of
the
British
and
Marathas
,
but
mostly
against
the
British
,
with
Mysore
receiving
some
aid
or
promise
of
aid
from
the
French
.
The
next
to
arrive
were
the
Dutch
,
with
their
main
base
in
Ceylon
.
The
British
—
who
set
up
a
trading
post
in
the
west
coast
port
of
Surat
in
1619
—
and
the
French
.
The
internal
conflicts
among
Indian
kingdoms
gave
opportunities
to
the
European
traders
to
gradually
establish
political
influence
and
appropriate
lands
.
Although
these
continental
European
powers
controlled
various
coastal
regions
of
southern
and
eastern
India
during
the
ensuing
century
,
they
eventually

The
Nawab
of
Bengal
Siraj
Ud
Daulah
,
the
de
facto
ruler
of
the
Bengal
province
,
opposed
British
attempts
to
use
these
permits
.
This
led
to
the
Battle
of
Plassey
on
23
June
1757
,
in
which
the
Bengal
Army
of
the
East
India
Company
,
led
by
Robert
Clive
,
defeated
the
French
-supported
Nawab
's
forces
.
This
was
the
first
real
political
foothold
with
territorial
implications
that
the
British
acquired
in
India
.
Clive
was
appointed
by
the
company
as
its
first
'
Governor
of
Bengal
'
in
1757
.
This
was
combined
with
British
victories
over
the
French
at
Madras
,
Wandiwash
and
Pondichéry
that
,
along
with
wider
British
successes
during
the
Seven
Years
'
War
,
reduced
French
influence
in
India
.
The
British
East
India
Company
extended
its
control
over
the
whole
of
Bengal
.
After
the
Battle
of
Buxar
in
1764
,
the
company
acquired
the
rights
of
administration
in
Bengal
from
de
jure
Mughal
Emperor
Shah
Alam
II
;
this
marked
the
beginning
of
its
formal
rule
,
which
within
the
next
century
engulfed
most
of
India
.
The
East
India
Company
monopolized
the
trade
of
Bengal
.
They
introduced
a
land
taxation
system
called
the
Permanent
Settlement
which
introduced
a
feudal
-
like
structure
in
Bengal
,
often
with
zamindars
set
in
place
.
As
a
result
of
the
three
Carnatic
Wars
,
the
British
East
India
Company
gained
exclusive
control
over
the
entire
Carnatic
region
of
India
.
The
Company
soon
expanded
its
territories
around
its
bases
in
Bombay
and
Madras
;
the
Anglo-
Mysore
Wars
(
1766–
1799
)
and
later
the
Anglo-
Maratha
Wars
(
1772
–
1818
)
led
to
control
of
the
vast
regions
of
India
.
Ahom
Kingdom
of
North-east
India
first
fell
to
Burmese
invasion
and
then
to
British
after
Treaty
of
Yandabo
in
1826
.
Punjab
,
North
-West
Frontier
Province
,
and
Kashmir
were
annexed
after
the
Second
Anglo
-
Sikh
War
in
1849
;
however
,
Kashmir
was
immediately
sold
under
the
Treaty
of
Amritsar
to
the
Dogra
Dynasty
of
Jammu
and
thereby
became
a
princely
state
.
The
border
dispute
between
Nepal
and
British
India
,
which
sharpened
after
1801
,
had
caused
the
Anglo-Nepalese
War
of
1814
–
16
and
brought
the
defeated
Gurkhas
under
British
influence
.
In
1854
,
Berar
was
annexed
,
and
the
state
of
Oudh
was
added
two
years
later
.
The
Indian
rebellion
of
1857
was
a
large-scale
rebellion
by
soldiers
employed
by
the
British
East
India
in
northern
and
central
India
against
the
Company
's
rule
.
The
rebels
were
disorganized
,
had
differing
goals
,
and
were
poorly
equipped
,
led
,
and
trained
,
and
had
no
outside
support
or
funding
.
They
were
brutally
suppressed
and
the
British
government
took
control
of
the
Company
and
eliminated
many
of
the
grievances
that
caused
it
.
The
government
also
was
determined
to
keep
full
control
so
that
no
rebellion
of
such
size
would
ever
happen
again
.
In
the
aftermath
,
all
power
was
transferred
from
the
East
India
Company
to
the
British
Crown
,
which
began
to
administer
most
of
India
as
a
number
of
provinces
.
The
Crown
controlled
the
Company
's
lands
directly
and
had
considerable
indirect
influence
over
the
rest
of
India
,
which
consisted
of
the
Princely
states
ruled
by
local
royal
families
.
There
were
officially
565
princely
states
in
1947
,
but
only
21
had
actual
state
governments
,
and
only
three
were
large
(
Mysore
,
Hyderabad
and
Kashmir
)
.
They
were
absorbed
into
the
independent
nation
in
1947
–
48
.
After
1857
,
the
colonial
government
strengthened
and
expanded
its
infrastructure
via
the
court
system
,
legal
procedures
,
and
statutes
.
The
Indian
Penal
Code
came
into
being
.
In
education
,
Thomas
Babington
Macaulay
had
made
schooling
a
priority
for
the
Raj
in
his
famous
minute
of
February
1835
and
succeeded
in
implementing
the
use
of
English
as
the
medium
of
instruction
.
By
1890
some
60,000
Indians
had
matriculated
.
The
Indian
economy
grew
at
about
1
%
per
year
from
1880
to
1920
,
and
the
population
also
grew
at
1
%
.
However
,
from
1910s
Indian
private
industry
began
to
grow
significantly
.
India
built
a
modern
railway
system
in
the
late
19th
century
which
was
the
fourth
largest
in
the
world
.
The
British
Raj
invested
heavily
in
infrastructure
,
including
canals
and
irrigation
systems
in
addition
to
railways
,
telegraphy
,
roads
and
ports
.
However
,
historians
have
been
bitterly
divided
on
issues
of
economic
history
,
with
the
Nationalist
school
arguing
that
India
was
poorer
at
the
end
of
British
rule
than
at
the
beginning
and
that
impoverishment
occurred
because
of
the
British
.
In
1905
,
Lord
Curzon
split
the
large
province
of
Bengal
into
a
largely
Hindu
western
half
and
"
Eastern
Bengal
and
Assam
"
,
a
largely
Muslim
eastern
half
.
The
British
goal
was
said
to
be
for
efficient
administration
but
the
people
of
Bengal
were
outraged
at
the
apparent
"
divide
and
rule
"
strategy
.
It
also
marked
the
beginning
of
the
organized
anti-colonial
movement
.
When
the
Liberal
party
in
Britain
came
to
power
in
1906
,
he
was
removed
.
Bengal
was
reunified
in
1911
.
The
new
Viceroy
Gilbert
Minto
and
the
new
Secretary
of
State
for
India
John
Morley
consulted
with
Congress
leaders
on
political
reforms
.
The
Morley
-
Minto
reforms
of
1909
provided
for
Indian
membership
of
the
provincial
executive
councils
as
well
as
the
Viceroy
's
executive
council
.
The
Imperial
Legislative
Council
was
enlarged
from
25
to
60
members
and
separate
communal
representation
for
Muslims
was
established
in
a
dramatic
step
towards
representative
and
responsible
government
.
Several
socio-religious
organizations
came
into
being
at
that
time
.
Muslims
set
up
the
All
India
Muslim
League
in
1906
.
It
was
not
a
mass
party
but
was
designed
to
protect
the
interests
of
the
aristocratic
Muslims
.
It
was
internally
divided
by
conflicting
loyalties
to
Islam
,
the
British
,
and
India
,
and
by
distrust
of
Hindus
.
The
Akhil
Bharatiya
Hindu
Mahasabha
and
Rashtriya
Swayamsevak
Sangh
(
RSS
)
sought
to
represent
Hindu
interests
though
the
later
always
claimed
it
to
be
a
"
cultural
"
organization
.
Sikhs
founded
the
Shiromani
Akali
Dal
in
1920
.
However
,
the
largest
and
oldest
political
party
Indian
National
Congress
,
founded
in
1885
,
is
perceived
to
have
attempted
to
keep
a
distance
from
the
socio-religious
movements
and
identity
politics
.
The
Bengali
Renaissance
refers
to
a
social
reform
movement
during
the
nineteenth
and
early
twentieth
centuries
in
the
Bengal
region
of
India
during
the
period
of
British
rule
dominated
by
English
educated
Bengali
Hindus
.
The
Bengal
Renaissance
can
be
said
to
have
started
with
Raja
Ram
Mohan
Roy
(
1772
–
1833
)
and
ended
with
Rabindranath
Tagore
(
1861
–
1941
)
,
although
many
stalwarts
thereafter
continued
to
embody
particular
aspects
of
the
unique
intellectual
and
creative
output
of
the
region
.
Nineteenth
century
Bengal
was
a
unique
blend
of
religious
and
social
reformers
,
scholars
,
literary
giants
,
journalists
,
patriotic
orators
,
and
scientists
,
all
merging
to
form
the
image
of
a
renaissance
,
and
marked
the
transition
from
the
'
medieval
'
to
the
'
modern
'
.
During
this
period
,
Bengal
witnessed
an
intellectual
awakening
that
is
in
some
way
similar
to
the
Renaissance
in
Europe
during
the
16th
century
,
although
Europeans
of
that
age
were
not
confronted
with
the
challenge
and
influence
of
alien
colonialism
.
This
movement
questioned
existing
orthodoxies
,
particularly
with
respect
to
women
,
marriage
,
the
dowry
system
,
the
caste
system
,
and
religion
.
One
of
the
earliest
social
movements
that
emerged
during
this
time
was
the
Young
Bengal
movement
,
which
espoused
rationalism
and
atheism
as
the
common
denominators
of
civil
conduct
among
upper
caste
educated
Hindus
.
It
played
an
important
role
in
reawakening
Indian
minds
and
intellect
across
the
sub-continent
.
During
the
British
Raj
,
famines
in
India
,
often
attributed
to
failed
government
policies
,
were
some
of
the
worst
ever
recorded
,
including
the
Great
Famine
of
1876–78
in
which
6.1
million
to
10.3
million
people
died
and
the
Indian
famine
of
1899
–
1900
in
which
1.25
to
10
million
people
died
.
The
Third
Plague
Pandemic
in
the
mid-19th
century
killed
10
million
people
in
India
.
Despite
persistent
diseases
and
famines
,
the
population
of
the
Indian
subcontinent
,
which
stood
at
about
125
million
in
1750
,
had
reached
389
million
by
1941
.
One
of
the
most
important
events
of
the
19th
century
was
the
rise
of
Indian
nationalism
,
leading
Indians
to
seek
first
"
self-rule
"
and
later
"
complete
independence
"
.
However
,
historians
are
divided
over
the
causes
of
its
rise
.
Probable
reasons
include
a
"
clash
of
interests
of
the
Indian
people
with
British
interests
"
,
"
racial
discriminations
"
,
"
the
revelation
of
India
's
past
"
,
"
inter-linking
of
the
new
social
groups
in
different
regions
"
,
and
Indians
coming
in
close
contact
with
"
European
education
"
.
The
first
step
toward
Indian
self-rule
was
the
appointment
of
councillors
to
advise
the
British
viceroy
in
1861
and
the
first
Indian
was
appointed
in
1909
.
Provincial
Councils
with
Indian
members
were
also
set
up
.
The
councillors
'
participation
was
subsequently
widened
into
legislative
councils
.
The
British
built
a
large
British
Indian
Army
,
with
the
senior
officers
all
British
and
many
of
the
troops
from
small
minority
groups
such
as
Gurkhas
from
Nepal
and
Sikhs
.
The
civil
service
was
increasingly
filled
with
natives
at
the
lower
levels
,
with
the
British
holding
the
more
senior
positions
.
Bal
Gangadhar
Tilak
,
an
Indian
nationalist
leader
,
declared
Swaraj
as
the
destiny
of
the
nation
.
His
popular
sentence
"
Swaraj
is
my
birthright
,
and
I
shall
have
it
"
became
the
source
of
inspiration
for
Indians
.
Tilak
was
backed
by
rising
public
leaders
like
Bipin
Chandra
Pal
and
Lala
Lajpat
Rai
,
who
held
the
same
point
of
view
.
Under
them
,
India
's
three
big
provinces
–
Maharashtra
,
Bengal
and
Punjab
,
India
shaped
the
demand
of
the
people
and
India
's
nationalism
.
In
1907
,
the
Congress
was
split
into
two
factions
:
The
radicals
,
led
by
Tilak
,
advocated
civil
agitation
and
direct
revolution
to
overthrow
the
British
Empire
and
the
abandonment
of
all
things
British
.
The
moderates
,
led
by
leaders
like
Dadabhai
Naoroji
and
Gopal
Krishna
Gokhale
,
on
the
other
hand
wanted
reform
within
the
framework
of
British
rule
.
From
1920
leaders
such
as
Mahatma
Gandhi
began
highly
popular
mass
movements
to
campaign
against
the
British
Raj
using
largely
peaceful
methods
.
The
Gandhi-led
independence
movement
opposed
the
British
rule
using
non-violent
methods
like
non-cooperation
,
civil
disobedience
and
economic
resistance
.
However
,
revolutionary
activities
against
the
British
rule
took
place
throughout
the
Indian
subcontinent
and
some
others
adopted
a
militant
approach
like
the
Indian
National
Army
that
sought
to
overthrow
British
rule
by
armed
struggle
.
The
Government
of
India
Act
1935
was
a
major
success
in
this
regard
.
All
these
movements
succeeded
in
bringing
independence
to
the
new
dominions
of
India
and
Pakistan
on
15
August
1947
.
Along
with
the
desire
for
independence
,
tensions
between
Hindus
and
Muslims
had
also
been
developing
over
the
years
.
The
Muslims
had
always
been
a
minority
within
the
subcontinent
,
and
the
prospect
of
an
exclusively
Hindu
government
made
them
wary
of
independence
;
they
were
as
inclined
to
mistrust
Hindu
rule
as
they
were
to
resist
the
foreign
Raj
,
although
Gandhi
called
for
unity
between
the
two
groups
in
an
astonishing
display
of
leadership
.
The
British
,
extremely
weakened
by
the
Second
World
War
,
promised
that
they
would
leave
and
participated
in
the
formation
of
an
interim
government
.
The
British
Indian
territories
gained
independence
in
1947
,
after
being
partitioned
into
the
Union
of
India
and
Dominion
of
Pakistan
.
Following
the
controversial
division
of
pre-partition
Punjab
and
Bengal
,
rioting
broke
out
between
Sikhs
,
Hindus
and
Muslims
in
these
provinces
and
spread
to
several
other
parts
of
India
,
leaving
some
500,000
dead
.
Also
,
this
period
saw
one
of
the
largest
mass
migrations
ever
recorded
in
modern
history
,
with
a
total
of
12
million
Hindus
,
Sikhs
and
Muslims
moving
between
the
newly
created
nations
of
India
and
Pakistan
(
which
gained
independence
on
15
and
14
August
1947
respectively
)
.
In
1971
,
Bangladesh
,
formerly
East
Pakistan
and
East
Bengal
,
seceded
from
Pakistan
.
East
Prussia
enclosed
the
bulk
of
the
ancestral
lands
of
the
Baltic
Old
Prussians
.
During
the
13th
century
,
the
native
Prussians
were
conquered
by
the
crusading
Teutonic
Knights
.
The
indigenous
Balts
who
survived
the
conquest
were
gradually
converted
to
Christianity
.
Because
of
Germanization
and
colonisation
over
the
following
centuries
,
Germans
became
the
dominant
ethnic
group
,
while
Poles
and
Lithuanians
formed
minorities
.
From
the
13th
century
,
East
Prussia
was
part
of
the
monastic
state
of
the
Teutonic
Knights
.
After
the
Second
Peace
of
Thorn
in
1466
it
became
a
fief
of
the
Kingdom
of
Poland
.
In
1525
,
with
the
Prussian
Homage
,
the
province
became
the
Duchy
of
Prussia
.
The
Old
Prussian
language
had
become
extinct
by
the
17th
or
early
18th
century
.
Because
the
duchy
was
outside
of
the
core
Holy
Roman
Empire
,
the
prince-electors
of
Brandenburg
were
able
to
proclaim
themselves
King
of
Prussia
beginning
in
1701
.
After
the
annexation
of
most
of
western
Royal
Prussia
in
the
First
Partition
of
the
Polish
-Lithuanian
Commonwealth
in
1772
,
eastern
(
ducal
)
Prussia
was
connected
by
land
with
the
rest
of
the
Prussian
state
and
was
reorganized
as
a
province
the
following
year
(
1773
)
.
Between
1829
and
1878
,
the
Province
of
East
Prussia
was
joined
with
West
Prussia
to
form
the
Province
of
Prussia
.
The
Kingdom
of
Prussia
became
the
leading
state
of
the
German
Empire
after
its
creation
in
1871
.
However
,
the
Treaty
of
Versailles
following
World
War
I
granted
West
Prussia
to
Poland
and
made
East
Prussia
an
exclave
of
Weimar
Germany
(
the
new
Polish
Corridor
separating
East
Prussia
from
the
rest
of
Germany
)
,
while
the
Memel
Territory
was
detached
and
was
annexed
by
Lithuania
in
1923
.
Following
Nazi
Germany
's
defeat
in
World
War
II
in
1945
,
war-torn
East
Prussia
was
divided
at
Joseph
Stalin
's
insistence
between
the
Soviet
Union
(
the
Kaliningrad
Oblast
in
the
Russian
SFSR
and
the
constituent
counties
of
the
Klaipėda
Region
in
the
Lithuanian
SSR
)
and
the
People
's
Republic
of
Poland
(
the
Warmian

The
German

was
largely
evacuated
during
the
war

expelled
shortly
thereafter
in
the
expulsion
of
Germans
after
World
War
II

An
estimated

(
around

Upon
the
invitation
of
Duke
Konrad
I
of
Masovia
,
the
Teutonic
Knights
took
possession
of
Prussia
in
the
13th
century
and
created
a
monastic
state
to
administer
the
conquered
Old
Prussians
.
Local
Old-Prussian
(
north
)
and
Polish
(
south
)
toponyms
were
gradually
Germanised
.
The
Knights
'
expansionist
policies
,
including
occupation
of
Polish
Pomerania
with
Gdańsk
/
Danzig
and
western
Lithuania
,
brought
them
into
conflict
with
the
Kingdom
of
Poland
and
embroiled
them
in
several
wars
,
culminating
in
the
Polish
-Lithuanian
-
Teutonic
War
,
whereby
the
united
armies
of
Poland
and
Lithuania
,
defeated
the
Teutonic
Order
at
the
Battle
of
Grunwald
(
Tannenberg
)
in
1410
.
Its
defeat
was
formalised
in
the
Second
Treaty
of
Thorn
in
1466
ending
the
Thirteen
Years
'
War
,
and
leaving
the
former
Polish
region
Pomerania
/
Pomerelia
under
Polish
control
.
Together
with
Warmia
it
formed
the
province
of
Royal
Prussia
.
Eastern
Prussia
remained
under
the
Knights
,
but
as
a
fief
of
Poland
.
1466
and
1525
arrangements
by
kings
of
Poland
were
not
verified
by
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
as
well
as
the
previous
gains
of
the
Teutonic
Knights
were
not
verified
.
The
Teutonic
Order
lost
eastern
Prussia
when
Grand
Master
Albert
of
Brandenburg
-Ansbach
converted
to
Lutheranism
and
secularized
the
Prussian
branch
of
the
Teutonic
Order
in
1525
.
Albert
established
himself
as
the
first
duke
of
the
Duchy
of
Prussia
and
a
vassal
of
the
Polish
crown
by
the
Prussian
Homage
.
Walter
von
Cronberg
,
the
next
Grand
Master
,
was
enfeoffed
with
the
title
to
Prussia
after
the
Diet
of
Augsburg
in
1530
,
but
the
Order
never
regained
possession
of
the
territory
.
In
1569
the
Hohenzollern
prince-electors
of
the
Margraviate
of
Brandenburg
became
co-regents
with
Albert
's
son
,
the
feeble
-minded
Albert
Frederick
.
The
Administrator
of
Prussia
,
the
grandmaster
of
the
Teutonic
Order
Maximilian
III
,
son
of
emperor
Maximilian
II
died
in
1618
.
When
Maximilian
died
,
Albert
's
line
died
out
,
and
the
Duchy
of
Prussia
passed
to
the
Electors
of
Brandenburg
,
forming
Brandenburg
-
Prussia
.
Taking
advantage
of
the
Swedish
invasion
of
Poland
in
1655
,
and
instead
of
fulfilling
his
vassal
's
duties
towards
the
Polish
Kingdom
,
by
joining
forces
with
the
Swedes
and
subsequent
treaties
of
Wehlau
,
Labiau
,
and
Oliva
,
Elector
and
Duke
Frederick
William
succeeded
in
revoking
king
of
Poland
's
sovereignty
over
the
Duchy
of
Prussia
in
1660
.
The
absolutist
elector
also
subdued
the
noble
estates
of
Prussia
.
Although
Brandenburg
was
a
part
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
,
the
Prussian
lands
were
not
within
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
and
were
with
the
administration
by
the
Teutonic
Order
grandmasters
under
jurisdiction
of
the
Emperor
.
In
return
for
supporting
Emperor
Leopold
I
in
the
War
of
the
Spanish
Succession
,
Elector
Frederick
III
was
allowed
to
crown
himself
"
King
in
Prussia
"
in
1701
.
The
new
kingdom
ruled
by
the
Hohenzollern
dynasty
became
known
as
the
Kingdom
of
Prussia
.
The
designation
"
Kingdom
of
Prussia
"
was
gradually
applied
to
the
various
lands
of
Brandenburg
-
Prussia
.
To
differentiate
from
the
larger
entity
,
the
former
Duchy
of
Prussia
became
known
as
Altpreußen
(
"
Old
Prussia
"
)
,
the
province
of
Prussia
,
or
"
East
Prussia
"
.
Approximately
one-
third
of
East
Prussia
's
population
died
in
the
plague
and
famine
of
1709
–
1711
,
including
the
last
speakers
of
Old
Prussian
.
The
plague
,
probably
brought
by
foreign
troops
during
the
Great
Northern
War
,
killed
250,000
East
Prussians
,
especially
in
the
province
's
eastern
regions
.
Crown
Prince
Frederick
William
I
led
the
rebuilding
of
East
Prussia
,
founding
numerous
towns
.
Thousands
of
Protestants
expelled
from
the
Archbishopric
of
Salzburg
were
allowed
to
settle
in
depleted
East
Prussia
.
The
province
was
overrun
by
Imperial
Russian
troops
during
the
Seven
Years
'
War
.
In
the
1772
First
Partition
of
Poland
,
the
Prussian
king
Frederick
the
Great
annexed
neighboring
Royal
Prussia
,
i.e.
the
Polish
voivodeships
of
Pomerania
(
Gdańsk
Pomerania
or
Pomerelia
)
,
Malbork
,
Chełmno
and
the
Prince-Bishopric
of
Warmia
,
thereby
bridging
the
"
Polish
Corridor
"
between
his
Prussian
and
Farther
Pomeranian
lands
and
cutting
remaining
Poland
off
the
Baltic
Coast
.
The
territory
of
Warmia
was
incorporated
into
the
lands
of
former
Ducal
Prussia
,
which
,
by
administrative
deed
of
31
January
1773
were
named
East
Prussia
.
The
former
Polish
Pomerelian
lands
beyond
the
Vistula
River
together
with
Malbork
and
Chełmno
Land
formed
the
Province
of
West
Prussia
with
its
capital
at
Marienwerder
(
Kwidzyn
)
.
The
Polish
Partition
Sejm
ratified
the
cession
on
30
September
1773
,
whereafter
Frederick
officially
went
on
to
call
himself
a
King
"
of
"
Prussia
.
After
the
disastrous
defeat
of
the
Prussian
Army
at
the
Battle
of
Jena-Auerstedt
in
1806
,
Napoleon
occupied
Berlin
and
had
the
officials
of
the
Prussian
General
Directory
swear
an
oath
of
allegiance
to
him
,
while
King
Frederick
William
III
and
his
consort
Louise
fled
via
Königsberg
and
the
Curonian
Spit
to
Memel
.
The
French
troops
immediately
took
up
pursuit
but
were
delayed
in
the
Battle
of
Eylau
on
9
February
1807
by
an
East
Prussian
contingent
under
General
Anton
Wilhelm
von
L'Estocq
.
Napoleon
had
to
stay
at
the
Finckenstein
Palace
,
but
in
May
,
after
a
siege
of
75
days
,
his
troops
led
by
Marshal
François
Joseph
Lefebvre
were
able
to
capture
the
city
Danzig
,
which
had
been
tenaciously
defended
by
General
Count
Friedrich
Adolf
von
Kalkreuth
.
On
14
June
,
Napoleon
ended
the
War
of
the
Fourth
Coalition
with
his
victory
at
the
Battle
of
Friedland
.
Frederick
William
and
Queen
Louise
met
with
Napoleon
for
peace
negotiations
,
and
on
9
July
the
Prussian
king
signed
the
Treaty
of
Tilsit
.
The
succeeding
Prussian
reforms
instigated
by
Heinrich
Friedrich
Karl
vom
und
zum
Stein
and
Karl
August
von
Hardenberg
included
the
implementation
of
an
Oberlandesgericht
appellation
court
at
Königsberg
,
a
municipal
corporation
,
economic
freedom
as
well
as
emancipation
of
the
serfs
and
Jews
.
In
the
course
of
the
Prussian
restoration
by
the
1815
Congress
of
Vienna
,
the
East
Prussian
territories
were
re-arranged
in
the
Regierungsbezirke
of
Gumbinnen
and
Königsberg
.
From
1905
,
the
southern
districts
of
East
Prussia
formed
the
separate
Regierungsbezirk
of
Allenstein
.
East
and
West
Prussia
were
first
united
in
personal
union
in
1824
,
and
then
merged
in
a
real
union
in
1829
to
form
the
Province
of
Prussia
.
The
united
province
was
again
split
into
separate
East
and
West
Prussian
provinces
in
1878
.
The
population
of
the
province
in
1900
was
1,996,626
people
,
with
a
religious
makeup
of
1,698,465
Protestants
,
269,196
Roman
Catholics
,
and
13,877
Jews
.
The
Low
Prussian
dialect
predominated
in
East
Prussia
,
although
High
Prussian
was
spoken
in
Warmia
.
The
numbers
of
Masurians
,
Kursenieki
and
Prussian
Lithuanians
decreased
over
time
due
to
the
process
of
Germanization
.
The
Polish-speaking
population
concentrated
in
the
south
of
the
province
(
Masuria
and
Warmia
)
and
all
German
geographic
atlases
at
the
start
of
20th
century
showed
the
southern
part
of
East
Prussia
as
Polish
with
the
number
of
Poles
estimated
at
the
time
to
be
300,000
.
Kursenieki
inhabited
the
areas
around
the
Curonian
lagoon
,
while
Lithuanian
-
speaking
Prussians
concentrated
in
the
northeast
in
(
Lithuania
Minor
)
.
The
Old
Prussian
ethnic
group
became
completely
Germanized
over
time
and
the
Old
Prussian
language
died
out
in
the
18th
century
.
At
the
beginning
of
World
War
I
,
East
Prussia
became
a
theatre
of
war
when
the
Russian
Empire
invaded
the
country
.
The
Russian
Army
encountered
at
first
little
resistance
because
the
bulk
of
the
German
Army
had
been
directed
towards
the
Western
Front
according
to
the
Schlieffen
Plan
.
Despite
early
success
and
the
capture
of
the
towns
of
Rastenburg
and
Gumbinnen
,
in
the
Battle
of
Tannenberg
in
1914
and
the
Second
Battle
of
the
Masurian
Lakes
in
1915
,
the
Russians
were
decisively
defeated
and
forced
to
retreat
.
The
Russians
were
followed
by
the
German
Army
advancing
into
Russian
territory
.
With
the
forced
abdication
of
Emperor
William
II
in
1918
,
Germany
became
a
republic
.
Most
of
West
Prussia
and
the
former
Prussian
Province
of
Posen
,
territories
annexed
by
Prussia
in
the
18th
century
Partitions
of
Poland
,
were
ceded
to
the
Second
Polish
Republic
according
to
the
Treaty
of
Versailles
.
East
Prussia
became
an
exclave
,
being
separated
from
mainland
Germany
.
After
the
Treaty
of
Versailles
,
East
Prussia
was
separated
from
Germany
as
an
exclave
;
the
Memelland
was
also
separated
from
the
province
.
Because
most
of
West
Prussia
became
part
of
the
Second
Polish
Republic
as
the
Polish
Corridor
,
the
formerly
West
Prussian
Marienwerder
region
became
part
of
East
Prussia
(
as
Regierungsbezirk
Westpreußen
)
.
Also
Soldau
district
in
Allenstein
region
was
part
of
Second
Polish
Republic
.
The
Seedienst
Ostpreußen
was
established
to
provide
an
independent
transport
service
to
East
Prussia
.
Erich
Koch
headed
the
East
Prussian
Nazi
party
from
1928
.
He
led
the
district
from
1932
.
This
period
was
characterized
by
efforts
to
collectivize
the
local
agriculture
and
ruthlessness
in
dealing
with
his
critics
inside
and
outside
the
Party
.
He
also
had
long-term
plans
for
mass-scale
industrialization
of
the
largely
agricultural
province
.
These
actions
made
him
unpopular
among
the
local
peasants
.
In
1932
the
local
paramilitary
SA
had
already
started
to
terrorise
their
political
opponents
.
On
the
night
of
31
July
1932
there
was
a
bomb
attack
on
the
headquarters
of
the
Social
Democrats
in
Königsberg
,
the
Otto-Braun-House
.
The
Communist
politician
Gustav
Sauf
was
killed
;
the
executive
editor
of
the
Social
Democrat
"
Königsberger
Volkszeitung
"
,
Otto
Wyrgatsch
,
and
the
German
People
's
Party
politician
Max
von
Bahrfeldt
were
severely
injured
.
Members
of
the
Reichsbanner
were
attacked
and
the
local
Reichsbanner
Chairman
of
Lötzen
,
Kurt
Kotzan
,
was
murdered
on
6
August
1932
.
Through
publicly
funded
emergency
relief
programs
concentrating
on
agricultural
land-improvement
projects
and
road
construction
,
the
"
Erich
Koch
Plan
"
for
East
Prussia
allegedly
made
the
province
free
of
unemployment
;
on
August
16
,
1933
Koch
reported
to
Hitler
that
unemployment
had
been
banished
entirely
from
East
Prussia
,
a
feat
that
gained
admiration
throughout
the
Reich
.
Koch
's
industrialization
plans
led
him
into
conflict
with
R.
Walther
Darré
,
who
held
the
office
of
the
Reich
Peasant
Leader
(
Reichsbauernführer
)
and
Minister
of
Agriculture
.
Darré
,
a
neopaganist
rural
romantic
,
wanted
to
enforce
his
vision
of
an
agricultural
East
Prussia
.
When
his
"
Land
"
representatives
challenged
Koch
's
plans
,
Koch
had
them
arrested
.
In
1938
the
Nazis
altered
about
one
-
third
of
the
toponyms
of
the
area
,
eliminating
,
Germanizing
,
or
simplifying
a
number
of
Old
Prussian
names
,
as
well
as
those
Polish
or
Lithuanian
names
originating
from
colonists
and
refugees
to
Prussia
during
and
after
the
Protestant
Reformation
.
More
than
1,500
places
were
ordered
to
be
renamed
by
16
July
1938
following
a
decree
issued
by
Gauleiter
and
Oberpräsident
Erich
Koch
and
initiated
by
Adolf
Hitler
.
Many
who
would
not
cooperate
with
the
rulers
of
Nazi
Germany
were
sent
to
concentration
camps
and
held
prisoner
there
until
their
death
or
liberation
.
In
1939
East
Prussia
had
2.49
million
inhabitants
,
85
%
of
them
ethnic
Germans
,
the
others
Poles
in
the
south
who
,
according
to
Polish
estimates
numbered
in
the
interwar
period
around
300,000
-
350,000
,
the
Latvian
speaking
Kursenieki
,
and
Lietuvininkai
who
spoke
Lithuanian
in
the
northeast
.
Most
German
East
Prussians
,
Masurians
,
Kursieniki
,
and
Lietuvininkai
were
Lutheran
,
while
the
population
of
Ermland
was
mainly
Roman
Catholic
due
to
the
history
of
its
bishopric
.
The
East
Prussian
Jewish
Congregation
declined
from
about
9,000
in
1933
to
3,000
in
1939
,
as
most
fled
from
Nazi
rule
.
Those
who
remained
were
later
deported
and
killed
in
the
Holocaust
.
In
1939
the
Regierungsbezirk
Zichenau
was
annexed
by
Germany
and
incorporated
into
East
Prussia
.
Parts
of
it
were
transferred
to
other
regions
,
e.g.
Suwałki
to
Regierungsbezirk
Gumbinnen
and
Soldau
to
Regierungsbezirk
Allenstein
.
Despite
Nazi
propaganda
presenting
all
of
the
regions
annexed
as
possessing
significant
German
populations
that
wanted
reunification
with
Germany
,
the
Reich
's
statistics
of
late
1939
show
that
only
31,000
out
of
994,092
people
in
this
territory
were
ethnic
Germans
.

Following
Nazi
Germany
's
defeat
in
World
War
II
in
1945
,
East
Prussia
was
partitioned
between
Poland
and
the
Soviet
Union
according
to
the
Potsdam
Conference
.
Southern
East
Prussia
was
placed
under
Polish
administration
,
while
northern
East
Prussia
was
divided
between
the
Soviet
republics
of
Russia
(
the
Kaliningrad
Oblast
)
and
Lithuania
(
the
constituent
counties
of
the
Klaipėda
Region
)
.
The
city
of
Königsberg
was
renamed
Kaliningrad
in
1946
.
The
German
population
of
the
province
largely
evacuated
during
the
war
,
but
several
hundreds
of
thousands
died
during
the
years
1944
–
46
and
the
remainder
were
subsequently
expelled
.
Shortly
after
the
end
of
the
war
in
May
1945
,
Germans
who
had
fled
in
early
1945
tried
to
return
to
their
homes
in
East
Prussia
.
An
estimated
number
of
800,000
Germans
were
living
in
East
Prussia
during
the
summer
of
1945
.
Many
more
were
prevented
from
returning
,
[
citation

and
the
German
population
of
East
Prussia
was
almost
completely
expelled
by
the
communist
regimes
.
During
the
war
and
for
some
time
thereafter
45
camps
were
established
for
about
200,000
-250,000
forced
labourers
,
the
vast
majority
of
whom
were
deported
to
the
Soviet
Union
,
including
the
Gulag
camp
system
.
The
largest
camp
with
about
48,000
inmates
was
established
at
Deutsch
Eylau
(
Iława
)
.
Orphaned
children
who
were
left
behind
in
the
zone
occupied
by
the
Soviet
Union
were
referred
to
as
Wolf
children
.
Representatives
of
the
Polish
government
officially
took
over
the
civilian
administration
of
the
southern
part
of
East
Prussia
on
23
May
1945
.
Subsequently
Polish
expatriates
from
Polish
lands
annexed
by
the
Soviet
Union
as
well
as
Ukrainians
and
Lemkos
from
southern
Poland
,
expelled
in
Operation
Vistula
in
1947
,
were
settled
in
the
southern
part
of
East
Prussia
,
now
the
Polish
Warmian
-
Masurian
Voivodeship
.
In
1950
the
Olsztyn
Voivodeship
counted
689,000
inhabitants
,
22.6
%
of
them
coming
from
areas
annexed
by
the
Soviet
Union
,
10
%
Ukrainians
,
and
18.5
%
of
them
pre-war
inhabitants
.
The
remaining
pre-war
population
was
treated
as
Germanized
Poles
and
a
policy
of
re-Polonization
was
pursued
throughout
the
country
Most
of
these
"
Autochthones
"
chose
to
emigrate
to
West
Germany
from
the
1950s
through
1970s
(
between
1970
and
1988
55,227
persons
from
Warmia
and
Masuria
moved
to
Western
Germany
)
.
Local
toponyms
were
Polonised
by
the
Polish
Commission
for
the
Determination
of
Place
Names
.
In
April
1946
,
northern
East
Prussia
became
an
official
province
of
the
Russian
SFSR
as
the
"
Kyonigsbergskaya
Oblast
"
,
with
the
Memel
Territory
becoming
part
of
the
Lithuanian
SSR
.
In
June
1946
114,070
German
and
41,029
Soviet
citizens
were
registered
in
the
Oblast
,
with
an
unknown
number
of
disregarded
unregistered
persons
.
In
July
of
that
year
,
the
historic
city
of
Königsberg
was
renamed
Kaliningrad
to
honour
Mikhail
Kalinin
and
the
area
named
the
Kaliningrad
Oblast
.
Between
24
August
and
26
October
1948
21
transports
with
in
total
42,094
Germans
left
the
Oblast
to
the
Soviet
Occupation
Zone
(
which
became
East
Germany
)
.
The
last
remaining
Germans
left
in
November
1949
(
1,401
persons
)
and
January
1950
(
7
persons
)
.
A
similar
fate
befell
the
Curonians
who
lived
in
the
area
around
the
Curonian
Lagoon
.
While
many
fled
from
the
Red
Army
during
the
evacuation
of
East
Prussia
,
Curonians
that
remained
behind
were
subsequently
expelled
by
the
Soviet
Union
.
Only
219
lived
along
the
Curonian
Spit
in
1955
.
Many
had
German
names
such
as
Fritz
or
Hans
,
a
cause
for
anti-German
discrimination
.
The
Soviet
authorities
considered
the
Curonians
fascists
.
Because
of
this
discrimination
,
many
immigrated
to
West
Germany
in
1958
,
where
the
majority
of
Curonians
now
live
.
After
the
expulsion
of
the
German
population
ethnic
Russians
,
Belarusians
,
and
Ukrainians
were
settled
in
the
northern
part
.
In
the
Soviet
part
of
the
region
,
a
policy
of
eliminating
all
remnants
of
German
history
was
pursued
.
All
German
place
names
were
replaced
by
new
Russian
names
.
The
exclave
was
a
military
zone
,
which
was
closed
to
foreigners
;
Soviet
citizens
could
only
enter
with
special
permission
.
In
1967
the
remnants
of
Königsberg
Castle
were
demolished
on
the
orders
of
Leonid
Brezhnev
to
make
way
for
a
new
"
House
of
the
Soviets
"
.
Although
the
1945
–
1949
expulsion
of
Germans
from
the
northern
part
of
former
East
Prussia
was
often
conducted
in
a
violent
and
aggressive
way
by
Soviet
officials
,
the
present
Russian
inhabitants
of
the
Kaliningrad
Oblast
have
much
less
animosity
towards
Germans
.
German
names
have
been
revived
in
commercial
Russian
trade
and
there
is
sometimes
talk
of
reverting
Kaliningrad
's
name
to
its
historic
name
of
Königsberg
.
The
city
centre
of
Kaliningrad
was
completely
rebuilt
,
as
British
bombs
in
1944
and
the
Soviet
siege
in
1945
had
left
it
in
nothing
but
ruins
.
Since
1875
,
with
the
strengthening
of
self-rule
,
the
urban
and
rural
districts
(
Kreise
)
within
each
province
(
sometimes
within
each
governorate
)
formed
a
corporation
with
common
tasks
and
assets
(
schools
,
traffic
installations
,
hospitals
,
cultural
institutions
,
jails
etc.
)
called
the
Provinzialverband
(
provincial
association
)
.
Initially
the
assemblies
of
the
urban
and
rural
districts
elected
representatives
for
the
provincial
diets
(
Provinziallandtage
)
,
which
were
thus
indirectly
elected
.
As
of
1919
the
provincial
diets
(
or
as
to
governorate
diets
,
the
so-called
Kommunallandtage
)
were
directly
elected
by
the
citizens
of
the
provinces
(
or
governorates
,
respectively
)
.
These
parliaments
legislated
within
the
competences
transferred
to
the
provincial
associations
.
The
provincial
diet
of
East
Prussia
elected
a
provincial
executive
body
(
government
)
,
the
provincial
committee
(
Provinzialausschuss
)
,
and
a
head
of
province
,
the
Landeshauptmann
(
"
Land
Captain
"
;
till
the
1880s
titled
Landdirektor
,
land
director
)
.
Diarrhea
,
also
spelled
diarrhoea
,
is
the
condition
of
having
at
least
three
loose
or
liquid
bowel
movements
each
day
.
It
often
lasts
for
a
few
days
and
can
result
in
dehydration
due
to
fluid
loss
.
Signs
of
dehydration
often
begin
with
loss
of
the
normal
stretchiness
of
the
skin
and
irritable
behaviour
.
This
can
progress
to
decreased
urination
,
loss
of
skin
color
,
a
fast
heart
rate
,
and
a
decrease
in
responsiveness
as
it
becomes
more
severe
.
Loose
but
non-watery
stools
in
babies
who
are
breastfed
,
however
,
may
be
normal
.
The
most
common
cause
is
an
infection
of
the
intestines
due
to
either
a
virus
,
bacteria
,
or
parasite
;
a
condition
known
as
gastroenteritis
.
These
infections
are
often
acquired
from
food
or
water
that
has
been
contaminated
by
stool
,
or
directly
from
another
person
who
is
infected
.
It
may
be
divided
into
three
types
:
short
duration
watery
diarrhea
,
short
duration
bloody
diarrhea
,
and
if
it
lasts
for
more
than
two
weeks
,
persistent
diarrhea
.
The
short
duration
watery
diarrhea
may
be
due
to
an
infection
by
cholera
,
although
this
is
rare
in
the
developed
world
.
If
blood
is
present
it
is
also
known
as
dysentery
.
A
number
of
non-infectious
causes
may
also
result
in
diarrhea
,
including
hyperthyroidism
,
lactose
intolerance
,
inflammatory
bowel
disease
,
a
number
of
medications
,
and
irritable
bowel
syndrome
.
In
most
cases
,
stool
cultures
are
not
required
to
confirm
the
exact
cause
.
Prevention
of
infectious
diarrhea
is
by
improved
sanitation
,
clean
drinking
water
,
and
hand
washing
with
soap
.
Breastfeeding
for
at
least
six
months
is
also
recommended
as
is
vaccination
against
rotavirus
.
Oral
rehydration
solution
(
ORS
)
,
which
is
clean
water
with
modest
amounts
of
salts
and
sugar
,
is
the
treatment
of
choice
.
Zinc
tablets
are
also
recommended
.
These
treatments
have
been
estimated
to
have
saved
50
million
children
in
the
past
25
years
.
When
people
have
diarrhea
it
is
recommended
that
they
continue
to
eat
healthy
food
and
babies
continue
to
be
breastfed
.
If
commercial
ORS
are
not
available
,
homemade
solutions
may
be
used
.
In
those
with
severe
dehydration
,
intravenous
fluids
may
be
required
.
Most
cases
;
however
,
can
be
managed
well
with
fluids
by
mouth
.
Antibiotics
,
while
rarely
used
,
may
be
recommended
in
a
few
cases
such
as
those
who
have
bloody
diarrhea
and
a
high
fever
,
those
with
severe
diarrhea
following
travelling
,
and
those
who
grow
specific
bacteria
or
parasites
in
their
stool
.
Loperamide
may
help
decrease
the
number
of
bowel
movement
but
is
not
recommended
in
those
with
severe
disease
.
About
1.7
to
5
billion
cases
of
diarrhea
occur
per
year
.
It
is
most
common
in
developing
countries
,
where
young
children
get
diarrhea
on
average
three
times
a
year
.
Total
deaths
from
diarrhea
are
estimated
at
1.26
million
in
2013
–
down
from
2.58
million
in
1990
.
In
2012
,
it
is
the
second
most
common
cause
of
deaths
in
children
younger
than
five
(
0.76
million
or
11
%
)
.
Frequent
episodes
of
diarrhea
are
also
a
common
cause
of
malnutrition
and
the
most
common
cause
in
those
younger
than
five
years
of
age
.
Other
long
term
problems
that
can
result
include
stunted
growth
and
poor
intellectual
development
.
Secretory
diarrhea
means
that
there
is
an
increase
in
the
active
secretion
,
or
there
is
an
inhibition
of
absorption
.
There
is
little
to
no
structural
damage
.
The
most
common
cause
of
this
type
of
diarrhea
is
a
cholera
toxin
that
stimulates
the
secretion
of
anions
,
especially
chloride
ions
.
Therefore
,
to
maintain
a
charge
balance
in
the
lumen
,
sodium
is
carried
with
it
,
along
with
water
.
In
this
type
of
diarrhea
intestinal
fluid
secretion
is
isotonic
with
plasma
even
during
fasting
.
It
continues
even
when
there
is
no
oral
food
intake
.
Osmotic
diarrhea
occurs
when
too
much
water
is
drawn
into
the
bowels
.
If
a
person
drinks
solutions
with
excessive
sugar
or
excessive
salt
,
these
can
draw
water
from
the
body
into
the
bowel
and
cause
osmotic
diarrhea
.
Osmotic
diarrhea
can
also
be
the
result
of
maldigestion
(
e.g.
,
pancreatic
disease
or
Coeliac
disease
)
,
in
which
the
nutrients
are
left
in
the
lumen
to
pull
in
water
.
Or
it
can
be
caused
by
osmotic
laxatives
(
which
work
to
alleviate
constipation
by
drawing
water
into
the
bowels
)
.
In
healthy
individuals
,
too
much
magnesium
or
vitamin
C
or
undigested
lactose
can
produce
osmotic
diarrhea
and
distention
of
the
bowel
.
A
person
who
has
lactose
intolerance
can
have
difficulty
absorbing
lactose
after
an
extraordinarily
high
intake
of
dairy
products
.
In
persons
who
have
fructose
malabsorption
,
excess
fructose
intake
can
also
cause
diarrhea
.
High
-
fructose
foods
that
also
have
a
high
glucose
content
are
more
absorbable
and
less
likely
to
cause
diarrhea
.
Sugar
alcohols
such
as
sorbitol
(
often
found
in
sugar-free
foods
)
are
difficult
for
the
body
to
absorb
and
,
in
large
amounts
,
may
lead
to
osmotic
diarrhea
.
In
most
of
these
cases
,
osmotic
diarrhea
stops
when
offending
agent
(
e.g.
milk
,
sorbitol
)
is
stopped
.
Inflammatory
diarrhea
occurs
when
there
is
damage
to
the
mucosal
lining
or
brush
border
,
which
leads
to
a
passive
loss
of
protein-rich
fluids
and
a
decreased
ability
to
absorb
these
lost
fluids
.
Features
of
all
three
of
the
other
types
of
diarrhea
[
clarification
needed
]
can
be
found
in
this
type
of
diarrhea
.
It
can
be
caused
by
bacterial
infections
,
viral
infections
,
parasitic
infections
,
or
autoimmune
problems
such
as
inflammatory
bowel
diseases
.
It
can
also
be
caused
by
tuberculosis
,
colon
cancer
,
and
enteritis
.

Diarrheal
disease
may
have
a
negative
impact
on
both
physical
fitness
and
mental
development
.
"
Early
childhood
malnutrition
resulting
from
any
cause
reduces
physical
fitness
and
work
productivity
in
adults
,
"
and
diarrhea
is
a
primary
cause
of
childhood
malnutrition
.
Further
,
evidence
suggests
that
diarrheal
disease
has
significant
impacts
on
mental
development
and
health
;
it
has
been
shown
that
,
even
when
controlling
for
helminth
infection
and
early
breastfeeding
,
children
who
had
experienced
severe
diarrhea
had
significantly
lower
scores
on
a
series
of
tests
of
intelligence
.
Another
possible
cause
of
diarrhea
is
irritable
bowel
syndrome
(
IBS
)
,
which
usually
presents
with
abdominal
discomfort
relieved
by
defecation
and
unusual
stool
(
diarrhea
or
constipation
)
for
at
least
3
days
a
week
over
the
previous
3
months
.
Symptoms
of
diarrhea-
predominant
IBS
can
be
managed
through
a
combination
of
dietary
changes
,
soluble
fiber
supplements
,
and
/
or
medications
such
as
loperamide
or
codeine
.
About
30
%
of
patients
with
diarrhea-
predominant
IBS
have
bile
acid
malabsorption
diagnosed
with
an
abnormal
SeHCAT
test
.
Poverty
is
a
good
indicator
of
the
rate
of
infectious
diarrhea
in
a
population
.
This
association
does
not
stem
from
poverty
itself
,
but
rather
from
the
conditions
under
which
impoverished
people
live
.
The
absence
of
certain
resources
compromises
the
ability
of
the
poor
to
defend
themselves
against
infectious
diarrhea
.
"
Poverty
is
associated
with
poor
housing
,
crowding
,
dirt
floors
,
lack
of
access
to
clean
water
or
to
sanitary
disposal
of
fecal
waste
(
sanitation
)
,
cohabitation
with
domestic
animals
that
may
carry
human
pathogens
,
and
a
lack
of
refrigerated
storage
for
food
,
all
of
which
increase
the
frequency
of
diarrhea
...
Poverty
also
restricts
the
ability
to
provide
age
-
appropriate
,
nutritionally
balanced
diets
or
to
modify
diets
when
diarrhea
develops
so
as
to
mitigate
and
repair
nutrient
losses
.
The
impact
is
exacerbated
by
the
lack
of
adequate
,
available
,
and
affordable
medical
care
.
"
Proper
nutrition
is
important
for
health
and
functioning
,
including
the
prevention
of
infectious
diarrhea
.
It
is
especially
important
to
young
children
who
do
not
have
a
fully
developed
immune
system
.
Zinc
deficiency
,
a
condition
often
found
in
children
in
developing
countries
can
,
even
in
mild
cases
,
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
development
and
proper
functioning
of
the
human
immune
system
.
Indeed
,
this
relationship
between
zinc
deficiency
reduced
immune
functioning
corresponds
with
an
increased
severity
of
infectious
diarrhea
.
Children
who
have
lowered
levels
of
zinc
have
a
greater
number
of
instances
of
diarrhea
,
severe
diarrhea
,
and
diarrhea
associated
with
fever
.
Similarly
,
vitamin
A
deficiency
can
cause
an
increase
in
the
severity
of
diarrheal
episodes
,
however
there
is
some
discrepancy
when
it
comes
to
the
impact
of
vitamin
A
deficiency
on
the
rate
of
disease
.
While
some
argue
that
a
relationship
does
not
exist
between
the
rate
of
disease
and
vitamin
A
status
,
others
suggest
an
increase
in
the
rate
associated
with
deficiency
.
Given
that
estimates
suggest
127
million
preschool
children
worldwide
are
vitamin
A
deficient
,
this
population
has
the
potential
for
increased
risk
of
disease
contraction
.
According
to
two
researchers
,
Nesse
and
Williams
,
diarrhea
may
function
as
an
evolved
expulsion
defense
mechanism
.
As
a
result
,
if
it
is
stopped
,
there
might
be
a
delay
in
recovery
.
They
cite
in
support
of
this
argument
research
published
in
1973
that
found
that
treating
Shigella
with
the
anti-diarrhea
drug
(
Co-
phenotrope
,
Lomotil
)
caused
people
to
stay
feverish
twice
as
long
as
those
not
so
treated
.
The
researchers
indeed
themselves
observed
that
:
"
Lomotil
may
be
contraindicated
in
shigellosis
.
Diarrhea
may
represent
a
defense
mechanism
"
.
Basic
sanitation
techniques
can
have
a
profound
effect
on
the
transmission
of
diarrheal
disease
.
The
implementation
of
hand
washing
using
soap
and
water
,
for
example
,
has
been
experimentally
shown
to
reduce
the
incidence
of
disease
by
approximately
42–48
%
.
Hand
washing
in
developing
countries
,
however
,
is
compromised
by
poverty
as
acknowledged
by
the
CDC
:
"
Handwashing
is
integral
to
disease
prevention
in
all
parts
of
the
world
;
however
,
access
to
soap
and
water
is
limited
in
a
number
of
less
developed
countries
.
This
lack
of
access
is
one
of
many
challenges
to
proper
hygiene
in
less
developed
countries
.
"
Solutions
to
this
barrier
require
the
implementation
of
educational
programs
that
encourage
sanitary
behaviours
.
Given
that
water
contamination
is
a
major
means
of
transmitting
diarrheal
disease
,
efforts
to
provide
clean
water
supply
and
improved
sanitation
have
the
potential
to
dramatically
cut
the
rate
of
disease
incidence
.
In
fact
,
it
has
been
proposed
that
we
might
expect
an
88
%
reduction
in
child
mortality
resulting
from
diarrheal
disease
as
a
result
of
improved
water
sanitation
and
hygiene
.
Similarly
,
a
meta-analysis
of
numerous
studies
on
improving
water
supply
and
sanitation
shows
a

%
reduction
in
disease
incidence
,
and
a
21–30
%
reduction
in
mortality
rate
associated
with
diarrheal
disease
.
Immunization
against
the
pathogens
that
cause
diarrheal
disease
is
a
viable
prevention
strategy
,
however
it
does
require
targeting
certain
pathogens
for
vaccination
.
In
the
case
of
Rotavirus
,
which
was
responsible
for
around
6
%
of
diarrheal
episodes
and
20
%
of
diarrheal
disease
deaths
in
the
children
of
developing
countries
,
use
of
a
Rotavirus
vaccine
in
trials
in
1985
yielded
a
slight
(
2
-
3
%
)
decrease
in
total
diarrheal
disease
incidence
,
while
reducing
overall
mortality
by
6
-
10
%
.
Similarly
,
a
Cholera
vaccine
showed
a
strong
reduction
in
morbidity
and
mortality
,
though
the
overall
impact
of
vaccination
was
minimal
as
Cholera
is
not
one
of
the
major
causative
pathogens
of
diarrheal
disease
.
Since
this
time
,
more
effective
vaccines
have
been
developed
that
have
the
potential
to
save
many
thousands
of
lives
in
developing
nations
,
while
reducing
the
overall
cost
of
treatment
,
and
the
costs
to
society
.
Dietary
deficiencies
in
developing
countries
can
be
combated
by
promoting
better
eating
practices
.
Supplementation
with
vitamin
A
and
/
or
zinc
.
Zinc
supplementation
proved
successful
showing
a
significant
decrease
in
the
incidence
of
diarrheal
disease
compared
to
a
control
group
.
The
majority
of
the
literature
suggests
that
vitamin
A
supplementation
is
advantageous
in
reducing
disease
incidence
.
Development
of
a
supplementation
strategy
should
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
vitamin
A
supplementation
was
less
effective
in
reducing
diarrhea
incidence
when
compared
to
vitamin
A
and
zinc
supplementation
,
and
that
the
latter
strategy
was
estimated
to
be
significantly
more
cost
effective
.
In
many
cases
of
diarrhea
,
replacing
lost
fluid
and
salts
is
the
only
treatment
needed
.
This
is
usually
by
mouth
–
oral
rehydration
therapy
–
or
,
in
severe
cases
,
intravenously
.
Diet
restrictions
such
as
the
BRAT
diet
are
no
longer
recommended
.
Research
does
not
support
the
limiting
of
milk
to
children
as
doing
so
has
no
effect
on
duration
of
diarrhea
.
To
the
contrary
,
WHO
recommends
that
children
with
diarrhea
continue
to
eat
as
sufficient
nutrients
are
usually
still
absorbed
to
support
continued
growth
and
weight
gain
,
and
that
continuing
to
eat
also
speeds
up
recovery
of
normal
intestinal
functioning
.
CDC
recommends
that
children
and
adults
with
cholera
also
continue
to
eat
.
Oral
rehydration
solution
(
ORS
)
(
a
slightly
sweetened
and
salty
water
)
can
be
used
to
prevent
dehydration
.
Standard
home
solutions
such
as
salted
rice
water
,
salted
yogurt
drinks
,
vegetable
and
chicken
soups
with
salt
can
be
given
.
Home
solutions
such
as
water
in
which
cereal
has
been
cooked
,
unsalted
soup
,
green
coconut
water
,
weak
tea
(
unsweetened
)
,
and
unsweetened
fresh
fruit
juices
can
have
from
half
a
teaspoon
to
full
teaspoon
of
salt
(
from
one
-
and
-
a-
half
to
three
grams
)
added
per
liter
.
Clean
plain
water
can
also
be
one
of
several
fluids
given
.
There
are
commercial
solutions
such
as
Pedialyte
,
and
relief
agencies
such
as
UNICEF
widely
distribute
packets
of
salts
and
sugar
.
A
WHO
publication
for
physicians
recommends
a
homemade
ORS
consisting
of
one
liter
water
with
one
teaspoon
salt
(
3
grams
)
and
two
tablespoons
sugar
(
18
grams
)
added
(
approximately
the
"
taste
of
tears
"
)
.
Rehydration
Project
recommends
adding
the
same
amount
of
sugar
but
only
one
-
half
a
teaspoon
of
salt
,
stating
that
this
more
dilute
approach
is
less
risky
with
very
little
loss
of
effectiveness
.
Both
agree
that
drinks
with
too
much
sugar
or
salt
can
make
dehydration
worse
.
Drinks
especially
high
in
simple
sugars
,
such
as
soft
drinks
and
fruit
juices
,
are
not
recommended
in
children
under
5
years
of
age
as
they
may
increase
dehydration
.
A
too
rich
solution
in
the
gut
draws
water
from
the
rest
of
the
body
,
just
as
if
the
person
were
to
drink
sea
water
.
Plain
water
may
be
used
if
more
specific
and
effective
ORT
preparations
are
unavailable
or
are
not
palatable
.
Additionally
,
a
mix
of
both
plain
water
and
drinks
perhaps
too
rich
in
sugar
and
salt
can
alternatively
be
given
to
the
same
person
,
with
the
goal
of
providing
a
medium
amount
of
sodium
overall
.
A
nasogastric
tube
can
be
used
in
young
children
to
administer
fluids
if
warranted
.
WHO
recommends
a
child
with
diarrhea
continue
to
be
fed
.
Continued
feeding
speeds
the
recovery
of
normal
intestinal
function
.
In
contrast
,
children
whose
food
is
restricted
have
diarrhea
of
longer
duration
and
recover
intestinal
function
more
slowly
.
A
child
should
also
continue
to
be
breastfed
.
The
WHO
states
"
Food
should
never
be
withheld
and
the
child
's
usual
foods
should
not
be
diluted
.
Breastfeeding
should
always
be
continued
.
"
And
in
the
specific
example
of
cholera
,
CDC
also
makes
the
same
recommendation
.
In
young
children
who
are
not
breast-fed
and
live
in
the
developed
world
,
a
lactose
-
free
diet
may
be
useful
to
speed
recovery
.
While
antibiotics
are
beneficial
in
certain
types
of
acute
diarrhea
,
they
are
usually
not
used
except
in
specific
situations
.
There
are
concerns
that
antibiotics
may
increase
the
risk
of
hemolytic
uremic
syndrome
in
people
infected
with
Escherichia
coli
O157
:
H7
.
In
resource
-
poor
countries
,
treatment
with
antibiotics
may
be
beneficial
.
However
,
some
bacteria
are
developing
antibiotic
resistance
,
particularly
Shigella
.
Antibiotics
can
also
cause
diarrhea
,
and
antibiotic
-associated
diarrhea
is
the
most
common
adverse
effect
of
treatment
with
general
antibiotics
.
Richard
Phillips
Feynman
(
/
ˈfaɪnmən
/
;
May
11
,
1918
–
February
15
,
1988
)
was
an
American
theoretical
physicist
known
for
his
work
in
the
path
integral
formulation
of
quantum
mechanics
,
the
theory
of
quantum
electrodynamics
,
and
the
physics
of
the
superfluidity
of
supercooled
liquid
helium
,
as
well
as
in
particle
physics
for
which
he
proposed
the
parton
model
.
For
his
contributions
to
the
development
of
quantum
electrodynamics
,
Feynman
,
jointly
with
Julian
Schwinger
and
Sin-Itiro
Tomonaga
,
received
the
Nobel
Prize
in
Physics
in
1965
.
He
developed
a
widely
used
pictorial
representation
scheme
for
the
mathematical
expressions
governing
the
behavior
of
subatomic
particles
,
which
later
became
known
as
Feynman
diagrams
.
During
his
lifetime
,
Feynman
became
one
of
the
best-known
scientists
in
the
world
.
In
a
1999
poll
of
130
leading
physicists
worldwide
by
the
British
journal
Physics
World
he
was
ranked
as
one
of
the
ten
greatest
physicists
of
all
time
.
Feynman
was
a
keen
popularizer
of
physics
through
both
books
and
lectures
,
including
a
1959
talk
on
top-down
nanotechnology
called
There
's
Plenty
of
Room
at
the
Bottom
,
and
the
three
-volume
publication
of
his
undergraduate
lectures
,
The
Feynman
Lectures
on
Physics
.
Feynman
also
became
known
through
his
semi-autobiographical
books
Surely
You
're
Joking
,
Mr.
Feynman
!
and
What
Do
You
Care
What
Other
People
Think
?
and
books
written
about
him
,
such
as
Tuva
or
Bust
!
and
Genius
:
The
Life
and
Science
of
Richard
Feynman
by
James
Gleick
.
Richard
Phillips
Feynman
was
born
on
May
11
,
1918
,
in
Queens
,
New
York
City
,
the
son
of
Lucille
(
née
Phillips
)
,
a
homemaker
,
and
Melville
Arthur
Feynman
,
a
sales
manager
.
His
family
originated
from
Russia
and
Poland
;
both
of
his
parents
were
Ashkenazi
Jews
.
They
were
not
religious
,
and
by
his
youth
Feynman
described
himself
as
an
"
avowed
atheist
"
.
He
also
stated
"
To
select
,
for
approbation
the
peculiar
elements
that
come
from
some
supposedly
Jewish
heredity
is
to
open
the
door
to
all
kinds
of
nonsense
on
racial
theory
,
"
and
adding
"
...
at
thirteen
I
was
not
only
converted
to
other
religious
views
,
but
I
also
stopped
believing
that
the
Jewish
people
are
in
any
way
'
the
chosen
people
'
.
"
Later
in
his
life
,
during
a
visit
to
the
Jewish
Theological
Seminary
,
he
encountered
the
Talmud
for
the
first
time
,
and
remarked
that
he
found
it
a
"
wonderful
book
"
and
"
valuable
"
.
The
young
Feynman
was
heavily
influenced
by
his
father
,
who
encouraged
him
to
ask
questions
to
challenge
orthodox
thinking
,
and
who
was
always
ready
to
teach
Feynman
something
new
.
From
his
mother
he
gained
the
sense
of
humor
that
he
had
throughout
his
life
.
As
a
child
,
he
had
a
talent
for
engineering
,
maintained
an
experimental
laboratory
in
his
home
,
and
delighted
in
repairing
radios
.
When
he
was
in
grade
school
,
he
created
a
home
burglar
alarm
system
while
his
parents
were
out
for
the
day
running
errands
.
When
Richard
was
five
years
old
,
his
mother
gave
birth
to
a
younger
brother
,
but
this
brother
died
at
four
weeks
of
age
.
Four
years
later
,
Richard
gained
a
sister
,
Joan
,
and
the
family
moved
to
Far
Rockaway
,
Queens
.
Though
separated
by
nine
years
,
Joan
and
Richard
were
close
,
as
they
both
shared
a
natural
curiosity
about
the
world
.
Their
mother
thought
that
women
did
not
have
the
cranial
capacity
to
comprehend
such
things
.
Despite
their
mother
's
disapproval
of
Joan
's
desire
to
study
astronomy
,
Richard
encouraged
his
sister
to
explore
the
universe
.
Joan
eventually
became
an
astrophysicist
specializing
in
interactions
between
the
Earth
and
the
solar
wind
.
Feynman
attended
Far
Rockaway
High
School
,
a
school
in
Far
Rockaway
,
Queens
also
attended
by
fellow
Nobel
laureates
Burton
Richter
and
Baruch
Samuel
Blumberg
.
Upon
starting
high
school
,
Feynman
was
quickly
promoted
into
a
higher
math
class
.
An
unspecified
school-
administered
IQ
test
estimated
his
IQ
at
123
—
high
,
but
"
merely
respectable
"
according
to
biographer
James
Gleick
.
When
he
turned
15
,
he
taught
himself
trigonometry
,
advanced
algebra
,
infinite
series
,
analytic
geometry
,
and
both
differential
and
integral
calculus
.
In
high
school
he
was
developing
the
mathematical
intuition
behind
his
Taylor
series
of
mathematical
operators
.
Before
entering
college
,
he
was
experimenting
with
and
deriving
mathematical
topics
such
as
the
half-
derivative
using
his
own
notation
.
He
attained
a
perfect
score
on
the
graduate
school
entrance
exams
to
Princeton
University
in
mathematics
and
physics
—
an
unprecedented
feat
—
but
did
rather
poorly
on
the
history
and
English
portions
.
Attendees
at
Feynman
's
first
seminar
included
Albert
Einstein
,
Wolfgang
Pauli
,
and
John
von
Neumann
.
He
received
a
PhD
from
Princeton
in
1942
;
his
thesis
advisor
was
John
Archibald
Wheeler
.
Feynman
's
thesis
applied
the
principle
of
stationary
action
to
problems
of
quantum
mechanics
,
inspired
by
a
desire
to
quantize
the
Wheeler
–Feynman
absorber
theory
of
electrodynamics
,
laying
the
groundwork
for
the
"
path
integral
"
approach
and
Feynman
diagrams
,
and
was
titled
"
The
Principle
of
Least
Action
in
Quantum
Mechanics
"
.
At
Princeton
,
the
physicist
Robert
R.
Wilson
encouraged
Feynman
to
participate
in
the
Manhattan
Project
—
the
wartime
U.S.
Army
project
at
Los
Alamos
developing
the
atomic
bomb
.
Feynman
said
he
was
persuaded
to
join
this
effort
to
build
it
before
Nazi
Germany
developed
their
own
bomb
.
He
was
assigned
to
Hans
Bethe
's
theoretical
division
and
impressed
Bethe
enough
to
be
made
a
group
leader
.
He
and
Bethe
developed
the
Bethe–Feynman
formula
for
calculating
the
yield
of
a
fission
bomb
,
which
built
upon
previous
work
by
Robert
Serber
.
He
immersed
himself
in
work
on
the
project
,
and
was
present
at
the
Trinity
bomb
test
.
Feynman
claimed
to
be
the
only
person
to
see
the
explosion
without
the
very
dark
glasses
or
welder
's
lenses
provided
,
reasoning
that
it
was
safe
to
look
through
a
truck
windshield
,
as
it
would
screen
out
the
harmful
ultraviolet
radiation
.
On
witnessing
the
blast
,
Feynman
ducked
towards
the
floor
of
his
truck
because
of
the
immense
brightness
of
the
explosion
,
where
he
saw
a
temporary
"
purple
splotch
"
afterimage
of
the
event
.
Feynman
's
other
work
at
Los
Alamos
included
calculating
neutron
equations
for
the
Los
Alamos
"
Water
Boiler
"
,
a
small
nuclear
reactor
,
to
measure
how
close
an
assembly
of
fissile
material
was
to
criticality
.
On
completing
this
work
he
was
transferred
to
the
Oak
Ridge
facility
,
where
he
aided
engineers
in
devising
safety
procedures
for
material
storage
so
that
criticality
accidents
(
for
example
,
due
to
sub-critical
amounts
of
fissile
material
inadvertently
stored
in
proximity
on
opposite
sides
of
a
wall
)
could
be
avoided
.
He
also
did
theoretical
work
and
calculations
on
the
proposed
uranium
hydride
bomb
,
which
later
proved
not
to
be
feasible
.
Due
to
the
top
secret
nature
of
the
work
,
Los
Alamos
was
isolated
.
In
Feynman
's
own
words
,
"
There
was
n't
anything
to
do
there
.
"
Bored
,
he
indulged
his
curiosity
by
learning
to
pick
the
combination
locks
on
cabinets
and
desks
used
to
secure
papers
.
Feynman
played
many
jokes
on
colleagues
.
In
one
case
he
found
the
combination
to
a
locked
filing
cabinet
by
trying
the
numbers
he
thought
a
physicist
would
use
(
it
proved
to
be
27
–
18
–
28
after
the
base
of
natural
logarithms
,
e
=
2.71828
...
)
,
and
found
that
the
three
filing
cabinets
where
a
colleague
kept
a
set
of
atomic
bomb
research
notes
all
had
the
same
combination
.
He
left
a
series
of
notes
in
the
cabinets
as
a
prank
,
which
initially
spooked
his
colleague
,
Frederic
de
Hoffmann
,
into
thinking
a
spy
or
saboteur
had
gained
access
to
atomic
bomb
secrets
.
On
several
occasions
,
Feynman
drove
to
Albuquerque
to
see
his
ailing
wife
in
a
car
borrowed
from
Klaus
Fuchs
,
who
was
later
discovered
to
be
a
real
spy
for
the
Soviets
,
transporting
nuclear
secrets
in
his
car
to
Santa
Fe.
Feynman
alludes
to
his
thoughts
on
the
justification
for
getting
involved
in
the
Manhattan
project
in
The
Pleasure
of
Finding
Things
Out
.
He
felt
the
possibility
of
Nazi
Germany
developing
the
bomb
before
the
Allies
was
a
compelling
reason
to
help
with
its
development
for
the
U.S
.
He
goes
on
to
say
that
it
was
an
error
on
his
part
not
to
reconsider
the
situation
once
Germany
was
defeated
.
In
the
same
publication
,
Feynman
also
talks
about
his
worries
in
the
atomic
bomb
age
,
feeling
for
some
considerable
time
that
there
was
a
high
risk
that
the
bomb
would
be
used
again
soon
,
so
that
it
was
pointless
to
build
for
the
future
.
Later
he
describes
this
period
as
a
"
depression
"
.
Following
the
completion
of
his
PhD
in
1942
,
Feynman
held
an
appointment
at
the
University
of
Wisconsin–Madison
as
an
assistant
professor
of
physics
.
The
appointment
was
spent
on
leave
for
his
involvement
in
the
Manhattan
project
.
In
1945
,
he
received
a
letter
from
Dean
Mark
Ingraham
of
the
College
of
Letters
and
Science
requesting
his
return
to
UW
to
teach
in
the
coming
academic
year
.
His
appointment
was
not
extended
when
he
did
not
commit
to
return
.
In
a
talk
given
several
years
later
at
UW
,
Feynman
quipped
,
"
It
's
great
to

the
only
university
that
ever
had
the
good
sense
to
fire
me
.
"
After
the
war
,
Feynman
declined
an
offer
from
the
Institute
for
Advanced
Study
in
Princeton
,
New
Jersey
,
despite
the
presence
there
of
such
distinguished
faculty
members
as
Albert
Einstein
,
Kurt
Gödel
and
John
von
Neumann
.
Feynman
followed
Hans
Bethe
,
instead
,
to
Cornell
University
,
where
Feynman
taught
theoretical
physics
from
1945
to
1950
.
During
a
temporary
depression
following
the
destruction
of
Hiroshima
by
the
bomb
produced
by
the
Manhattan
Project
,
he
focused
on
complex
physics
problems
,
not
for
utility
,
but
for
self-satisfaction
.
One
of
these
was
analyzing
the
physics
of
a
twirling
,
nutating
dish
as
it
is
moving
through
the
air
.
His
work
during
this
period
,
which
used
equations
of
rotation
to
express
various
spinning
speeds
,
proved
important
to
his
Nobel
Prize–winning
work
,
yet
because
he
felt
burned
out
and
had
turned
his
attention
to
less
immediately
practical
problems
,
he
was
surprised
by
the
offers
of
professorships
from
other
renowned
universities
.
Despite
yet
another
offer
from
the
Institute
for
Advanced
Study
,
Feynman
rejected
the
Institute
on
the
grounds
that
there
were
no
teaching
duties
:
Feynman
felt
that
students
were
a
source
of
inspiration
and
teaching
was
a
diversion
during
uncreative
spells
.
Because
of
this
,
the
Institute
for
Advanced
Study
and
Princeton
University
jointly
offered
him
a
package
whereby
he
could
teach
at
the
university
and
also
be
at
the
institute
.

Feynman
instead
accepted
an
offer
from
the
California
Institute
of
Technology
(
Caltech
)
—
and
as
he
says
in
his
book
Surely
You
're
Joking
Mr.
Feynman
!
—
because
a
desire
to
live
in
a
mild
climate
had
firmly
fixed
itself
in
his
mind
while
he
was
installing
tire
chains
on
his
car
in
the
middle
of
a
snowstorm
in
Ithaca
.
Feynman
has
been
called
the
"
Great
Explainer
"
.
He
gained
a
reputation
for
taking
great
care
when
giving
explanations
to
his
students
and
for
making
it
a
moral
duty
to
make
the
topic
accessible
.
His
guiding
principle
was
that
,
if
a
topic
could
not
be
explained
in
a
freshman
lecture
,
it
was
not
yet
fully
understood
.
Feynman
gained
great
pleasure
from
coming
up
with
such
a
"
freshman
-
level
"
explanation
,
for
example
,
of
the
connection
between
spin
and
statistics
.
What
he
said
was
that
groups
of
particles
with
spin
½
"
repel
"
,
whereas
groups
with
integer
spin
"
clump
"
.
This
was
a
brilliantly
simplified
way
of
demonstrating
how
Fermi–Dirac
statistics
and
Bose
–Einstein
statistics
evolved
as
a
consequence
of
studying
how
fermions
and
bosons
behave
under
a
rotation
of
360°
.
This
was
also
a
question
he
pondered
in
his
more
advanced
lectures
,
and
to
which
he
demonstrated
the
solution
in
the
1986
Dirac
memorial
lecture
.
In
the
same
lecture
,
he
further
explained
that
antiparticles
must
exist
,
for
if
particles
had
only
positive
energies
,
they
would
not
be
restricted
to
a
so-called
"
light
cone
"
.
He
also
developed
Feynman
diagrams
,
a
bookkeeping
device
that
helps
in
conceptualizing
and
calculating
interactions
between
particles
in
spacetime
,
including
the
interactions
between
electrons
and
their
antimatter
counterparts
,
positrons
.
This
device
allowed
him
,
and
later
others
,
to
approach
time
reversibility
and
other
fundamental
processes
.
Feynman
's
mental
picture
for
these
diagrams
started
with
the
hard
sphere
approximation
,
and
the
interactions
could
be
thought
of
as
collisions
at
first
.
It
was
not
until
decades
later
that
physicists
thought
of
analyzing
the
nodes
of
the
Feynman
diagrams
more
closely
.
Feynman
painted
Feynman
diagrams
on
the
exterior
of
his
van
.
From
his
diagrams
of
a
small
number
of
particles
interacting
in
spacetime
,
Feynman
could
then
model
all
of
physics
in
terms
of
the
spins
of
those
particles
and
the
range
of
coupling
of
the
fundamental
forces
.
Feynman
attempted
an
explanation
of
the
strong
interactions
governing
nucleons
scattering
called
the
parton
model
.
The
parton
model
emerged
as
a
complement
to
the
quark
model
developed
by
his
Caltech
colleague
Murray
Gell
-
Mann
.
The
relationship
between
the
two
models
was
murky
;
Gell
-
Mann
referred
to
Feynman
's
partons
derisively
as
"
put-ons
"
.
In
the
mid-1960s
,
physicists
believed
that
quarks
were
just
a
bookkeeping
device
for
symmetry
numbers
,
not
real
particles
,
as
the
statistics
of
the
Omega-minus
particle
,
if
it
were
interpreted
as
three
identical
strange
quarks
bound
together
,
seemed
impossible
if
quarks
were
real
.
The
Stanford
linear
accelerator
deep
inelastic
scattering
experiments
of
the
late
1960s
showed
,
analogously
to
Ernest
Rutherford
's
experiment
of
scattering
alpha
particles
on
gold
nuclei
in
1911
,
that
nucleons
(
protons
and
neutrons
)
contained
point-like
particles
that
scattered
electrons
.
It
was
natural
to
identify
these
with
quarks
,
but
Feynman
's
parton
model
attempted
to
interpret
the
experimental
data
in
a
way
that
did
not
introduce
additional
hypotheses
.
For
example
,
the
data
showed
that
some
45
%
of
the
energy
momentum
was
carried
by
electrically
-
neutral
particles
in
the
nucleon
.
These
electrically
-
neutral
particles
are
now
seen
to
be
the
gluons
that
carry
the
forces
between
the
quarks
and
carry
also
the
three
-
valued
color
quantum
number
that
solves
the
Omega-minus
problem
.
Feynman
did
not
dispute
the
quark
model
;
for
example
,
when
the
fifth
quark
was
discovered
in
1977
,
Feynman
immediately
pointed
out
to
his
students
that
the
discovery
implied
the
existence
of
a
sixth
quark
,
which
was
discovered
in
the
decade
after
his
death
.
After
the
success
of
quantum
electrodynamics
,
Feynman
turned
to
quantum
gravity
.
By
analogy
with
the
photon
,
which
has
spin
1
,
he
investigated
the
consequences
of
a
free
massless
spin
2
field
,
and
derived
the
Einstein
field
equation
of
general
relativity
,
but
little
more
.
The
computational
device
that
Feynman
discovered
then
for
gravity
,
"
ghosts
"
,
which
are
"
particles
"
in
the
interior
of
his
diagrams
that
have
the
"
wrong
"
connection
between
spin
and
statistics
,
have
proved
invaluable
in
explaining
the
quantum
particle
behavior
of
the
Yang–Mills
theories
,
for
example
,
QCD
and
the
electro-weak
theory
.
Feynman
was
elected
a
Foreign
Member
of
the
Royal
Society
(
ForMemRS
)
in
1965
.
At
this
time
in
the
early
1960s
,
Feynman
exhausted
himself
by
working
on
multiple
major
projects
at
the
same
time
,
including
a
request
,
while
at
Caltech
,
to
"
spruce
up
"
the
teaching
of
undergraduates
.
After
three
years
devoted
to
the
task
,
he
produced
a
series
of
lectures
that
eventually
became
The
Feynman
Lectures
on
Physics
.
He
wanted
a
picture
of
a
drumhead
sprinkled
with
powder
to
show
the
modes
of
vibration
at
the
beginning
of
the
book
.
Concerned
over
the
connections
to
drugs
and
rock
and
roll
that
could
be
made
from
the
image
,
the
publishers
changed
the
cover
to
plain
red
,
though
they
included
a
picture
of
him
playing
drums
in
the
foreword
.
The
Feynman
Lectures
on
Physics
occupied
two
physicists
,
Robert
B.
Leighton
and
Matthew
Sands
,
as
part-time
co-authors
for
several
years
.
Even
though
the
books
were
not
adopted
by
most
universities
as
textbooks
,
they
continue
to
sell
well
because
they
provide
a
deep
understanding
of
physics
.
Many
of
his
lectures
and
miscellaneous
talks
were
turned
into
other
books
,
including
The
Character
of
Physical
Law
,
QED
:
The
Strange
Theory
of
Light
and
Matter
,
Statistical
Mechanics
,
Lectures
on
Gravitation
,
and
the
Feynman
Lectures
on
Computation
.
In
1974
,
Feynman
delivered
the
Caltech
commencement
address
on
the
topic
of
cargo
cult
science
,
which
has
the
semblance
of
science
,
but
is
only
pseudoscience
due
to
a
lack
of
"
a
kind
of
scientific
integrity
,
a
principle
of
scientific
thought
that
corresponds
to
a
kind
of
utter
honesty
"
on
the
part
of
the
scientist
.
He
instructed
the
graduating
class
that
"
The
first
principle
is
that
you
must
not
fool
yourself
—
and
you
are
the
easiest
person
to
fool
.
So
you
have
to
be
very
careful
about
that
.
After
you
've
not
fooled
yourself
,
it
's
easy
not
to
fool
other
scientists
.
You
just
have
to
be
honest
in
a
conventional
way
after
that
.
"
In
the
late
1980s
,
according
to
"
Richard
Feynman
and
the
Connection
Machine
"
,
Feynman
played
a
crucial
role
in
developing
the
first
massively
parallel
computer
,
and
in
finding
innovative
uses
for
it
in
numerical
computations
,
in
building
neural
networks
,
as
well
as
physical
simulations
using
cellular
automata
(
such
as
turbulent
fluid
flow
)
,
working
with
Stephen
Wolfram
at
Caltech
.
His
son
Carl
also
played
a
role
in
the
development
of
the
original
Connection
Machine
engineering
;
Feynman
influencing
the
interconnects
while
his
son
worked
on
the
software
.
Feynman
diagrams
are
now
fundamental
for
string
theory
and
M-theory
,
and
have
even
been
extended
topologically
.
The
world
-lines
of
the
diagrams
have
developed
to
become
tubes
to
allow
better
modeling
of
more
complicated
objects
such
as
strings
and
membranes
.
Shortly
before
his
death
,
Feynman
criticized
string
theory
in
an
interview
:
"
I
do
n't
like
that
they
're
not
calculating
anything
,
"
he
said
.
"
I
do
n't
like
that
they
do
n't
check
their
ideas
.
I
do
n't
like
that
for
anything
that
disagrees
with
an
experiment
,
they
cook
up
an
explanation
—
a
fix
-
up
to
say
,
'
Well
,
it
still
might
be
true
.
'
"
These
words
have
since
been
much
-quoted
by
opponents
of
the
string
-theoretic
direction
for
particle
physics
.
Feynman
devoted
the
latter
half
of
his
book
What
Do
You
Care
What
Other
People
Think
?
to
his
experience
on
the
Rogers
Commission
,
straying
from
his
usual
convention
of
brief
,
light
-
hearted
anecdotes
to
deliver
an
extended
and
sober
narrative
.
Feynman
's
account
reveals
a
disconnect
between
NASA
's
engineers
and
executives
that
was
far
more
striking
than
he
expected
.
His
interviews
of
NASA
's
high-
ranking
managers
revealed
startling
misunderstandings
of
elementary
concepts
.
For
instance
,
NASA
managers
claimed
that
there
was
a
1
in
100,000
chance
of
a
catastrophic
failure
aboard
the
shuttle
,
but
Feynman
discovered
that
NASA
's
own
engineers
estimated
the
chance
of
a
catastrophe
at
closer
to
1
in
200
.
He
concluded
that
the
space
shuttle
reliability
estimate
by
NASA
management
was
fantastically
unrealistic
,
and
he
was
particularly
angered
that
NASA
used
these
figures
to
recruit
Christa
McAuliffe
into
the
Teacher
-
in
-
Space
program
.
He
warned
in
his
appendix
to
the
commission
's
report
(
which
was
included
only
after
he
threatened
not
to
sign
the
report
)
,
"
For
a
successful
technology
,
reality
must
take
precedence
over
public
relations
,
for
nature
cannot
be
fooled
.
"
Although
born
to
and
raised
by
parents
who
were
Ashkenazi
,
Feynman
was
not
only
an
atheist
,
but
declined
to
be
labelled
Jewish
.
He
routinely
refused
to
be
included
in
lists
or
books
that
classified
people
by
race
.
He
asked
to
not
be
included
in
Tina
Levitan
's
The
Laureates
:
Jewish
Winners
of
the
Nobel
Prize
,
writing
,
"
To
select
,
for
approbation
the
peculiar
elements
that
come
from
some
supposedly
Jewish
heredity
is
to
open
the
door
to
all
kinds
of
nonsense
on
racial
theory
,
"
and
adding
"
...
at
thirteen
I
was
not
only
converted
to
other
religious
views
,
but
I
also
stopped
believing
that
the
Jewish
people
are
in
any
way
'
the
chosen
people
'
.
"
While
pursuing
his
PhD
at
Princeton
,
Feynman
married
his
high
school
sweetheart
,
Arline
Greenbaum
(
often
misspelled
"
Arlene
"
)
,
despite
the
knowledge
that
she
was
seriously
ill
with
tuberculosis
—
an
incurable
disease
at
the
time
.
She
died
in
1945
.
In
1946
,
Feynman
wrote
a
letter
to
her
,
expressing
his
deep
love
and
heartbreak
,
that
he
kept
for
the
rest
of
his
life
.
(
"
Please
excuse
my
not
mailing
this
,
"
the
letter
concluded
,
"
but
I
do
n't
know
your
new
address
.
"
)
This
portion
of
Feynman
's
life
was
portrayed
in
the
1996
film
Infinity
,
which
featured
Feynman
's
daughter
,
Michelle
,
in
a
cameo
role
.
Feynman
had
a
great
deal
of
success
teaching
Carl
,
using
,
for
example
,
discussions
about
ants
and
Martians
as
a
device
for
gaining
perspective
on
problems
and
issues
.
He
was
surprised
to
learn
that
the
same
teaching
devices
were
not
useful
with
Michelle
.
Mathematics
was
a
common
interest
for
father
and
son
;
they
both
entered
the
computer
field
as
consultants
and
were
involved
in
advancing
a
new
method
of
using
multiple
computers
to
solve
complex
problems
—
later
known
as
parallel
computing
.
The
Jet
Propulsion
Laboratory
retained
Feynman
as
a
computational
consultant
during
critical
missions
.
One
co-worker
characterized
Feynman
as
akin
to
Don
Quixote
at
his
desk
,
rather
than
at
a
computer
workstation
,
ready
to
do
battle
with
the
windmills
.
Feynman
traveled
to
Brazil
,
where
he
gave
courses
at
the
BCPF
(
Brazilian
Center
for
Physics
Research
)
and
near
the
end
of
his
life
schemed
to
visit
the
Russian
land
of
Tuva
,
a
dream
that
,
because
of
Cold
War
bureaucratic
problems
,
never
became
reality
.
The
day
after
he
died
,
a
letter
arrived
for
him
from
the
Soviet
government
,
giving
him
authorization
to
travel
to
Tuva
.
Later
Feynman
's
daughter
Michelle
would
realize
this
journey
.
Out
of
his
enthusiastic
interest
in
reaching
Tuva
came
the
phrase
"
Tuva
or
Bust
"
(
also
the
title
of
a
book
about
his
efforts
to
get
there
)
,
which
was
tossed
about
frequently
amongst
his
circle
of
friends
in
hope
that
they
,
one
day
,
could
see
it
firsthand
.
The
documentary
movie
,
Genghis
Blues
,
mentions
some
of
his
attempts
to
communicate
with
Tuva
and
chronicles
the
successful
journey
there
by
his
friends
.
Responding
to
Hubert
Humphrey
's
congratulation
for
his
Nobel
Prize
,
Feynman
admitted
to
a
long
admiration
for
the
then
vice
president
.
According
to
Genius
,
the
James
Gleick
-
authored
biography
,
Feynman
tried
LSD
during
his
professorship
at
Caltech
.
Somewhat
embarrassed
by
his
actions
,
he
largely
sidestepped
the
issue
when
dictating
his
anecdotes
;
he
mentions
it
in
passing
in
the
"
O
Americano
,
Outra
Vez
"
section
,
while
the
"
Altered
States
"
chapter
in
Surely
You
're
Joking
,
Mr.
Feynman
!
describes
only
marijuana
and
ketamine
experiences
at
John
Lilly
's
famed
sensory
deprivation
tanks
,
as
a
way
of
studying
consciousness
.
Feynman
gave
up
alcohol
when
he
began
to
show
vague
,
early
signs
of
alcoholism
,
as
he
did
not
want
to
do
anything
that
could
damage
his
brain
—
the
same
reason
given
in
"
O
Americano
,
Outra
Vez
"
for
his
reluctance
to
experiment
with
LSD
.
In
Surely
You
're
Joking
,
Mr.
Feynman
!
,
he
gives
advice
on
the
best
way
to
pick
up
a
girl
in
a
hostess
bar
.
At
Caltech
,
he
used
a
nude
or
topless
bar
as
an
office
away
from
his
usual
office
,

When
the
county
officials
tried
to
close
the

,
all
visitors
except
Feynman
refused
to
testify
in

of

fearing
that
their
families

patrons
would
learn
about

Only
Feynman
accepted
,
and
in
court
,
he
affirmed
that
the
bar
was
a
public
need
,
stating
that
craftsmen
,
technicians
,
engineers
,
common
workers
,
"
and
a

"
frequented
the
establishment

While
the
bar
lost
the
court
case
,
it
was
allowed
to
remain
open

was
pending
appeal

recounts
the

Murray
Gell

described
what
has
become
known
as
"
The
Feynman
Algorithm
"
or
"
The

to
a

"
The

asks
Gell

about

Gell

says
no

Dick

not
the

The

asks
,
well
,
what
are
Feynman
's
methods
?
Gell

Mann
leans
coyly
against
the
blackboard
and
says
:
Dick
's
method
is
this
.
You
write
down
the
problem
.
You
think
very
hard

He
shuts

River
was
extensively
farmed
during
the
Early
Agricultural
period
,
circa
1200
BC
to
AD
150
.
These
people
constructed
irrigation
canals
and
grew
corn
,
beans
,
and
other
crops
while
gathering
wild
plants
and
hunting
.
The
Early
Ceramic
period
occupation
of
Tucson
saw
the
first
extensive
use
of
pottery
vessels
for
cooking
and
storage
.
The
groups
designated
as
the
Hohokam
lived
in
the
area
from
AD
600
to
1450
and
are
known
for
their
vast
irrigation
canal
systems
and
their

in
1700
about
7
mi
(
11
km
)
upstream
from
the
site
of
the
settlement
of
Tucson
.
A

.
During
the
Spanish
period
of
the
presidio
,
attacks
such
as
the
Second
Battle
of
Tucson
were
repeatedly
mounted
by
Apaches
.
Eventually
the
town
came
to
be
called
"
Tucson
"
and
became
a
part
of
Sonora
after
Mexico
gained
independence
from
Spain
in
1821

was
legally
bought
from

,
1854
.
Tucson
became
a
part
of
the
United

of
America
,
although
the
American
military
did
not
formally
take
over
control
until
March
1856
.
In
1857
Tucson
became
a
stage
station
on
the
San
Antonio

and
in
1858
became
3rd
division
headquarters
of
the

until
the
line
shut
down
in
March
1861
.
The

Corporation
attempted
to
continue
running
,
however
following
the
Bascom
Affair
,
devastating
Apache
attacks
on
the
stations
and
coaches
ended
operations
in

From
1877
to
1878
,
the
area
suffered
a
rash
of
stagecoach
robberies
.
Most
notable
,
however
,
were
the
two
holdups
committed
by
masked
road-agent
William
Whitney
Brazelton
.
Brazelton
held
up
two
stages
in
the
summer
of
1878
near
Point
of
Mountain
Station
approximately
17
mi
(
27

northwest
of
Tucson
.
John
Clum
,
of
Tombstone
,
Arizona
fame
was
one
of
the
passengers
.
Brazelton
was
eventually
tracked
down
and
killed
on
Monday
August
19
,
1878
,
in
a
mesquite
bosque
along
the
Santa
Cruz
River
3
miles
(
5
km
)
south
of
Tucson
by
Pima
County
Sheriff
Charles
A.
Shibell
and
his
citizen
's
posse
.
Brazelton
had
been
suspected
of
highway
robbery
not
only
in
the
Tucson
area
,
but
also
in
the
Prescott
region
and
Silver
City
,
New
Mexico
area
as
well
.
Brazelton
's
crimes
prompted
John
J.
Valentine
,
Sr.
of

to
send
special
agent
and
future
Pima
County
sheriff

wife
,
Marietta
,
at
the
coroner
's
inquest
on
Morgan
Earp
's
shooting
.
The

's
jury
concluded
that
Spence
,
Stilwell
,
Frederick
Bode
,
and
Florentino
"
Indian
Charlie
"
Cruz
were
the
prime
suspects
in
the
assassination

accompanied
Virgil
Earp
and
his
family
as
they
traveled
to
Benson
for
a
train
ride
to
California
.
They
found
Stilwell
lying
in
wait
for
Virgil
in
the
Tucson
station
and
killed
him
on
the
tracks
.
After
killing
Stilwell
,
Wyatt
deputized
others

rode
on
a
vendetta
,
killing
three
more

On
Sentinel
Peak
(
also
known
as
"
'
A
'
Mountain
"
)
,
just
west
of
downtown
,
there
is
a
giant
"
A
"
in
honor
of
the
University
of
Arizona
.
Starting
in
about
1916
,
a
yearly
tradition
developed
for
freshmen
to
whitewash
the
"
A
"
,
which
was
visible
for
miles
.
However
,
at
the
beginning
of
the
Iraq
War
,
anti-war
activists
painted
it
black
.
This
was
followed
by
a
paint
scuffle
where
the
"
A
"
was
painted
various
colors
until
the
city
council
intervened
.
It
is
now
red
,
white
and
blue
except
when
it
is
white
or
another
color
decided
by
a
biennial
election
.
Because
of
the
three
-
color
paint
scheme
often
used
,
the
shape
of
the
A
can
be
vague
and
indistinguishable
from
the
rest
of
the
peak
.
The
top
of
Sentinel
Peak
,
which
is
accessible
by
road
,
offers
an
outstanding
scenic
view
of
the
city
looking
eastward
.
A
parking
lot
located
near
the
summit
of
Sentinel
Peak
was
formerly
a
popular
place
to
watch
sunsets
or
view
the
city
lights
at
night
.

This
area
has
become
one
of
Tucson
's
iconic
neighborhoods
.
In
1891
,
the
Fort
was
abandoned
and
much
of
the
interior
was
stripped
of
their
useful
components
and
it
quickly
fell
into
ruin
.
In
1900
,
three
of
the
officer
buildings
were
purchased
for
use
as
a
sanitarium
.
The
sanitarium
was
then
sold
to
Harvey
Adkins
in

purchased
and
renovated
surviving
adobe
buildings
of
the
Fort
–
transforming
them
into
spectacular
artistic
southwestern
architectural
examples
.
Their
woodwork
,
plaster
treatment
and
sense
of

their
Dutch
heritage
and
New

Tucson
has
a
desert
climate
(
Köppen
BWh
)
,
with
two
major
seasons
,
summer
and
winter
;
plus
three
minor
seasons
:
fall
,
spring
,
and
the
monsoon
.
Tucson
averages
11.8
inches
(
299.7
mm
)
of
precipitation
per
year
,
more
than
most
other
locations
with
desert
climates
,
but
it
still
qualifies
due
to
its
high
evapotranspiration
;
in
other
words
,
it
experiences
a
high
net
loss
of
water
.
A
similar
scenario
is
seen
in
Alice
Springs
,
Australia
,
which
averages
11
inches
(
279.4
mm
)
a
year
,
but
has
a
desert
climate
.
The
monsoon
can
begin
any
time
from
mid-June
to
late
July
,
with
an
average
start
date
around
July
3
.
It
typically
continues
through
August
and
sometimes
into
September
.
During
the
monsoon
,
the
humidity
is
much
higher
than
the
rest
of
the
year
.
It
begins
with
clouds
building
up
from
the
south
in
the
early
afternoon
followed
by
intense
thunderstorms
and
rainfall
,
which
can
cause
flash
floods
.
The
evening
sky
at
this
time
of
year
is
often
pierced
with
dramatic
lightning
strikes
.
Large
areas
of
the
city
do
not
have
storm
sewers
,
so
monsoon
rains
flood
the
main
thoroughfares
,
usually
for
no
longer
than
a
few
hours
.
A
few
underpasses
in
Tucson
have
"
feet
of
water
"
scales
painted
on
their
supports
to
discourage
fording
by
automobiles
during
a
rainstorm
.
Arizona
traffic
code
Title
28-
910
,
the
so-called
"
Stupid
Motorist
Law
"
,
was
instituted
in
1995
to
discourage
people
from
entering
flooded
roadways
.
If
the
road
is
flooded
and
a
barricade
is
in
place
,
motorists
who
drive
around
the
barricade
can
be
charged
up
to
$
2000
for
costs
involved
in
rescuing
them
.
Despite
all
warnings
and
precautions
,
however
,
three
Tucson
drivers
have
drowned
between
2004

Another
popular
event
held
in
February
,
which
is
early
spring
in
Tucson
,
is
the
Fiesta
de
los
Vaqueros
,
or
rodeo
week
,
founded
by
winter
visitor
,
Leighton
Kramer
.
While
at
its
heart
the
Fiesta
is
a
sporting
event
,
it
includes
what
is
billed
as
"
the
world
's
largest
non-mechanized
parade
"
.
The
Rodeo
Parade
is
a
popular
event
as
most
schools
give
two
rodeo
days
off
instead
of
Presidents
Day
.
The
exception
to
this
is
Presidio
High
(
a
non-public
charter
school
)
,
which
does
n't
get
either
.
Western
wear
is
seen
throughout
the
city
as
corporate
dress
codes
are
cast
aside
during
the
Fiesta
.
The
Fiesta
de
los
Vaqueros
marks
the
beginning
of
the
rodeo
season
in
the
United
States
.
The
Procession
,
held
at
sundown
,
consists
of
a
non-motorized
parade
through
downtown
Tucson
featuring
many
floats
,
sculptures
,
and
memorials
,
in
which
the
community
is
encouraged
to
participate
.
The
parade
is
followed
by
performances
on
an
outdoor
stage
,
culminating
in
the
burning
of
an
urn
in
which
written
prayers
have
been
collected
from
participants
and
spectators
.
The
event
is
organized
and
funded
by
the
non-profit
arts
organization
Many
Mouths
One
Stomach
,
with
the
assistance
of
many
volunteers
and
donations
from
the
public
and
local
businesses
.
The
accomplished
and
awarded
writers
(
poets

,
nonfiction
writers
)
who
have
lived
in
Tucson
include
Edward
Abbey
,
Erskine
Caldwell
,
Barbara
Kingsolver
and
David
Foster
Wallace
.
Some
were
associated
with
the
University
of
Arizona
,
but
many
were
independent
writers
who
chose
to
make
Tucson
their
home
.
The
city
is
particularly
active
in
publishing
and
presenting
contemporary
innovative
poetry
in
various
ways
.
Examples
are
the
Chax
Press
,
a
publisher
of
poetry
books
in
trade
and
book
arts
editions
,
and
the
University
of
Arizona
Poetry
Center
,
which
has
a
sizable
poetry
library
and
presents
readings
,
conferences
,
and
workshops
.
Tucson
is
commonly
known
as
"
The
Old
Pueblo
"
.
While
the
exact
origin
of
this
nickname
is
uncertain
,
it
is
commonly
traced
back
to
Mayor
R.
N.
"
Bob
"
Leatherwood
.
When
rail
service
was
established
to
the
city
on
March
20
,
1880
,
Leatherwood
celebrated
the
fact
by
sending
telegrams
to
various
leaders
,
including
the
President
of
the
United
States
and
the
Pope
,
announcing
that
the
"
ancient
and
honorable
pueblo
"
of
Tucson
was
now
connected
by
rail
to
the
outside
world
.
The
term
became
popular
with
newspaper
writers
who
often
abbreviated
it
as
"
A.
and
H.
Pueblo
"
.
This
in
turn
transformed
into
the
current
form
of
"
The
Old
Pueblo
"
.
The
University
of
Arizona
Wildcats
sports
teams
,
most
notably
the
men's
basketball

swim
team
for
a
number
of
years

to
2013
.
They
served
as
the
AAA
affiliate
of
the
San

.
The
team
,
formerly
known
as
the
Portland
Beavers
,
was
temporarily
relocated
to
Tucson
from
Portland
while
awaiting
the
building
of
a
new
stadium
in
Escondido
.
Legal
issues
derailed
the
plans
to
build
the
Escondido
stadium
,
so
they
moved
to
El
Paso
,
Texas
for
the
2014
season
.
Previously
,
the
Tucson
Sidewinders
,
a

.
The
Sidewinders
played
in

and
were
in
the
Pacific
Conference
South
of
the
PCL
.
The
Sidewinders
were
sold
in
2007
and
moved
to
Reno
,
Nevada
after
the
2008
season
.
They
now
compete
as
the

and
is
one
of
only
two
asphalt
short

in
Arizona
.
Rillito
Downs
is
an
in-town
destination
on
weekends
in
January
and
February
each
year
.
This
historic
track
held
the
first
organized
quarter

,
and
they
are
still
racing
there
.
The

In
general
,
Tucson
and
Pima
County
support
the
Democratic
Party
,
as
opposed
the
state
's
largest
metropolitan
area
,
Phoenix
,
which
usually
supports
the
Republican
Party
.
Congressional
redistricting
in
2013
,
following
the
publication
of
the
2010
Census
,
divided
the
Tucson
area
into
three
Federal
Congressional
districts
(
the
first
,
second

third
of
Arizona
)
.
The

,
represented
by
Raul
Grijalva
,
a
Democrat
,
since
2003
,
while
the
more

are
in
the
2nd
District
,
represented
by
Republican
Martha
McSally
since
2015
,
and
the
exurbs
north

Tucson
is
known
for
being
a
trailblazer
in
voluntary
partial
publicly
financed
campaigns
.
Since
1985
,
both
mayoral
and
council
candidates
have
been
eligible
to
receive
matching
public
funds
from
the
city
.
To
become
eligible
,
council
candidates
must
receive
200
donations
of
$
10
or
more
(
300
for
a
mayoral
candidate
)
.
Candidates
must
then
agree
to
spending
limits
equal
to
33
¢
for
every
registered
Tucson
voter
,
or
$
79,222
in
2005
(
the
corresponding
figures
for
mayor
are
64
¢
per
registered
voter
,
or
$
142,271
in
2003
)
.
In
return
,
candidates
receive
matching
funds
from
the
city
at
a
1:1
ratio
of
public
money

.
The
only
other
limitation
is
that
candidates
may
not
exceed
75
%
of
the
limit
by
the
date
of
the
primary
.
Many
cities

have
copied
this

The
air
pollution
generated
has
raised
some
concerns
as
the
Sundt
operating
station
has
been
online
since

as
is
exempt
from
many
pollution
standards
and
controls
due
to
its
age
.
Solar
has
been
gaining
ground
in
Tucson
with
its
ideal
over
300
days
of
sunshine
climate
.
Federal
,
state
,
and
even
local
utility
credits
and
incentives
have
also
enticed
residents
to
equip
homes
with
solar
systems
.
Davis
-
Monthan
AFB
has
a
3.3
Megawatt
(
MW
)
ground
-mounted

photovoltaic
(
PV

array
and
a
2.7
MW
rooftop-mounted
PV
array
,
both
of
which
are
located
in
the
Base
Housing
area
.
The
base
will
soon
have
the
largest
solar-generating
capacity
in
the
United

Department
of

after
awarding

contract
on

.
Perhaps
the
biggest
sustainability
problem
in
Tucson
,
with
its
high
desert
climate
,
is
potable
water
supply
.
The
state
manages
all
water
in
Arizona
through
its
Arizona
Department
of
Water
Resources
(
ADWR
)
.
The
primary
consumer
of
water
is
Agriculture
(
including
golf
courses
)
,
which
consumes
about
69
%
of
all
water
.
Municipal
(
which
includes
residential
use
)
accounts
for
about
25
%
of
use
.
Energy
consumption
and
availability
is
another
sustainability
issue
.
However
,
with
over
300
days
of
full
sun
a
year
,
Tucson
has
demonstrated
its
potential
to
be
an
ideal
solar
energy
producer
.
In
an
effort
to
conserve
water
,
Tucson
is
recharging
groundwater
supplies
by
running
part
of
its
share
of
CAP
water
into
various
open
portions
of
local
rivers
to
seep
into
their
aquifer
.
Additional
study
is
scheduled
to
determine
the
amount
of
water
that
is
lost
through
evaporation
from
the
open
areas
,
especially
during
the
summer
.
The
City
of
Tucson
already
provides
reclaimed
water
to
its
inhabitants
,
but
it
is
only
used
for
"
applications
such
as
irrigation
,
dust
control
,
and
industrial
uses
.
"
These
resources
have
been
in
place
for
more
than
27
years
,
and
deliver
to
over
900
locations
.
To
prevent
further
loss
of
groundwater
,
Tucson
has
been
involved
in
water
conservation
and
groundwater
preservation
efforts
,
shifting
away
from
its
reliance
on
a
series
of
Tucson
area
wells
in
favor
of
conservation
,
consumption
-
based
pricing
for
residential
and
commercial
water
use
,
and
new
wells
in
the
more
sustainable
Avra
Valley
aquifer
,
northwest
of
the
city
.
An
allocation
from
the
Central
Arizona
Project
Aqueduct
(
CAP
)
,
which
passes
more
than
300
mi
(
480
km
)
across
the
desert
from
the
Colorado
River
,
has
been
incorporated
into
the
city
's
water
supply
,
annually
providing
over
20
million
gallons
of
"
recharged
"
water
which
is
pumped
into
the
ground
to
replenish
water
pumped
out
.
Since
2001
,
CAP
water
has
allowed
the
city
to
remove
or
turn
off
over
80
wells
.

,
it

and
the

largest
in

world
.
With

,
Iran
is
the

-
most-populous
country
.
It
is
the
only
country
that
has
both
a

.
Iran
has
long
been
of
geostrategic
importance
because
of
its
central
location
in
Eurasia
and
Western
Asia
,
and
its
proximity
to
the
Strait
of
Hormuz
.
Iran
is
home
to
one
of
the
world
's
oldest
civilizations
,
beginning
with
the
formation
of
the
Proto-Elamite
and
Elamite
kingdoms
in
3200
–
2800
BC
.
The
Iranian
Medes
unified
the
area
into
the
first
of
many
empires
in
625
BC
,
after
which
it
became
the
dominant
cultural
and
political
power
in
the
region
.
Iran
reached
the
pinnacle
of
its
power
during
the
Achaemenid
Empire
founded
by
Cyrus
the
Great
in
550
BC
,
which
at
its
greatest
extent
comprised
major
portions
of
the
ancient
world
,
stretching
from
parts
of
the
Balkans
(
Thrace
-
Macedonia
,
Bulgaria
-
Paeonia
)
and
Eastern
Europe
proper
in
the
west
,
to
the
Indus
Valley
in
the
east
,
making
it
the
largest
empire
the
world
had
yet
seen
.
The
empire
collapsed
in
330
BC
following
the
conquests
of
Alexander
the
Great
.
The
Parthian
Empire
emerged
from
the
ashes
and
was
succeeded
by
the
Sassanid
Dynasty
in
224
AD
,
under
which
Iran
again
became
one
of
the
leading
powers
in
the
world
,
along
with
the
Roman-Byzantine
Empire
,
for
a
period
of
more
than
four
centuries
.
In
633
AD
,
Rashidun
Arabs
invaded
Iran
and
conquered
it
by
651
AD
,
largely
converting
Iranian
people
from
their
indigenous
faiths
of
Manichaeism
and
Zoroastrianism
to
Sunni
Islam
.
Arabic
replaced
Persian
as
the
official
language
,
while
Persian
remained
the
language
of
both
ordinary
people
and
of
literature
.
Iran
became
a
major
contributor
to
the
Islamic
Golden
Age
,
producing
many
influential
scientists
,
scholars
,
artists
,
and
thinkers
.
Establishment
of
the
Safavid
Dynasty
in
1501
,
converted
the
Iranian
people
from
Sunni
Islam
to
Twelver
Shia
Islam
,
and
made
Twelver
Shia
Islam
the
official
religion
of
Iran
.
Safavid
conversion
of
Iran
from
Sunnism
to
Shiism
marked
one
of
the
most
important
turning
points
in
Iranian
and
Muslim
history
.
Starting
in
1736
under
Nader
Shah
,
Iran
reached
its
greatest
territorial
extent
since
the
Sassanid
Empire
,
briefly
possessing
what
was
arguably
the
most
powerful
empire
at
the
time
.
During
the
19th
century
,
Iran
irrevocably
lost
swaths
of
its
territories
in
the
Caucasus
which
made
part
of
the
concept
of
Iran
for
centuries
,
to
neighboring
Imperial
Russia
.
Popular
unrest
culminated
in
the
Persian
Constitutional
Revolution
of
1906
,
which
established
a
constitutional
monarchy
and
the
country
's
first
Majles
(
parliament
)
.
Following
a
coup
d'état
instigated
by
the
U.K.
and
the
U.S.
in
1953
,
Iran
gradually
became
close
allies
with
the
United
States
and
the
rest
of
the
West
,
remained
secular
,
but
grew
increasingly
autocratic
.
Growing
dissent
against
foreign
influence
and
political
repression
culminated
in
the
1979
Revolution
,
which
led
to
the
establishment
of
an
Islamic
republic
on
1
April
1979
.
Tehran
is
the
country
's
capital
and
largest
city
,
as
well
as
its
leading
cultural
and
economic
center
.
Iran
is
a
major
regional
and
middle
power
,
exerting
considerable
influence
in
international
energy
security
and
the
world
economy
through
its
large
reserves
of
fossil
fuels
,
which
include
the
largest
natural
gas
supply
in
the
world
and
the
fourth
-
largest
proven
oil
reserves
.
Iran
's
rich
cultural
legacy
is
reflected
in
part
by
its
19
UNESCO
World
Heritage
Sites
,
the
fourth
-
largest
number
in
Asia
and
12th
-
largest
in
the
world
.
The
term
Iran
derives
directly
from
Middle
Persian
Ērān
,
first
attested
in
a
3rd-
century
inscription
at
Rustam
Relief
,
with
the
accompanying
Parthian
inscription
using
the
term
Aryān
,
in
reference
to
Iranians
.
The
Middle
Iranian
ērān
and
aryān
are
oblique
plural
forms
of
gentilic
ēr
-
(
Middle
Persian
)
and
ary
-
(
Parthian
)
,
both
deriving
from
Proto-Iranian
*
arya
-
(
meaning
"
Aryan
,
"
i.e.
,
"
of
the
Iranians
"
)
,
argued
to
descend
from
Proto-Indo
-
European
*
ar-
yo
-
,
meaning
"
skillful
assembler
.
"
In
Iranian
languages
,
the
gentilic
is
attested
as
a
self-identifier
included
in
ancient
inscriptions
and
the
literature
of
Avesta
,
[
a
]
and
remains
also
in
other
Iranian
ethnic
names
such
as
Alans
(
Ossetic
:
Ир
–
Ir
)
and
Iron
(
Ossetic
:
Ирон
–
Iron
)
.
Historically
,
Iran
has
been
referred
to
as
Persia
by
the
West
,
due
mainly
to
the
writings
of
Greek
historians
who
called
Iran
Persis
(
Greek
:
Περσίς
)
,
meaning
"
land
of
the
Persians
.
"
As
the
most
extensive
interactions
the
Ancient
Greeks
had
with
any
outsider
was
with
the
Persians
,
the
term
persisted
,
even
long
after
the
Persian
rule
in
Greece
.
However
,
Persis
(
Old
Persian
:
Pārśa
;
Modern
Persian
:
Pārse
)
was
originally
referred
to
a
region
settled
by
Persians
in
the
west
shore
of
Lake
Urmia
,
in
the
9th
century
BC
.
The
settlement
was
then
shifted
to
the
southern
end
of
the
Zagros
Mountains
,
and
is
today
defined
as
Fars
Province
.
In
1935
,
Reza
Shah
requested
the
international
community
to
refer
to
the
country
by
its
native
name
,
Iran
.
As
the
New
York
Times
explained
at
the
time
,
"
At
the
suggestion
of
the
Persian
Legation
in
Berlin
,
the
Tehran
government
,
on
the
Persian
New
Year
,
Nowruz
,
March
21
,
1935
,
substituted
Iran
for
Persia
as
the
official
name
of
the
country
.
"
Opposition
to
the
name
change
led
to
the
reversal
of
the
decision
,
and
Professor
Ehsan
Yarshater
,
editor
of
Encyclopædia
Iranica
,
propagated
a
move
to
use
Persia
and
Iran
interchangeably
.
Today
,
both
Persia
and
Iran
are
used
in
cultural
contexts
;
although
,
Iran
is
the
name
used
officially
in
political
contexts
.
The
earliest
archaeological
artifacts
in
Iran
,
like
those
excavated
at
the
Kashafrud
and
Ganj
Par
sites
,
attest
to
a
human
presence
in
Iran
since
the
Lower
Paleolithic
era
,
c.
800,000
–
200,000
BC
.
Iran's
Neanderthal
artifacts
from
the
Middle
Paleolithic
period
,
c.
200,000
–
40,000
BC
,
have
been
found
mainly
in
the
Zagros
region
,
at
sites
such
as
Warwasi
and
Yafteh
Cave
.

Around
10th
to
8th
millennium
BC
,
early
agricultural
communities
such
as
Chogha
Golan
and
Chogha
Bonut
began
to
flourish
in
Iran
,
as
well
as
Susa
and
Chogha
Mish
developing
in
and
around
the
Zagros
region
.
[

The
emergence
of
Susa
as
a
city
,
as
determined
by
radiocarbon
dating
,
dates
back
to
early
4,395
BC
.
There
are
dozens
of
prehistoric
sites
across
the
Iranian
plateau
,
pointing
to
the
existence
of
ancient
cultures
and
urban
settlements
in
the
4th
millennium
BC
.
During
the
Bronze
Age
,
Iran
was
home
to
several
civilizations
including
Elam
,
Jiroft
,
and
Zayande
River
.
Elam
,
the
most
prominent
of
these
civilizations
,
developed
in
the
southwest
of
Iran
,
alongside
those
in
Mesopotamia
.
The
emergence
of
writing
in
Elam
was
paralleled
to
Sumer
,
and
the
Elamite
cuneiform
was
developed
since
the
3rd
millennium
BC
.
From
the
late
10th
to
late
7th
centuries
BC
,
the
Iranian
peoples
,
together
with
the
pre-Iranian
kingdoms
,
fell
under
the
domination
of
the
Assyrian
Empire
,
based
in
northern
Mesopotamia
.
Under
king
Cyaxares
,
the
Medes
and
Persians
entered
into
an
alliance
with
Nabopolassar
of
Babylon
,
as
well
as
the
Scythians
and
the
Cimmerians
,
and
together
they
attacked
the
Assyrian
Empire
.
The
civil
war
ravaged
the
Assyrian
Empire
between
616
BC
and
605
BC
,
thus
freeing
their
respective
peoples
from
three
centuries
of
Assyrian
rule
.
The
unification
of
the
Median
tribes
under
a
single
ruler
in
728
BC
led
to
the
foundation
of
the
Median
Empire
which
,
by
612
BC
,
controlled
the
whole
Iran
and
the
eastern
Anatolia
.
This
marked
the
end
of
the
Kingdom
of
Urartu
as
well
,
which
was
subsequently
conquered
and
dissolved
.
In
550
BC
,
Cyrus
the
Great
,
son
of
Mandane
and
Cambyses
I
,
took
over
the
Median
Empire
,
and
founded
the
Achaemenid
Empire
by
unifying
other
city
states
.
The
conquest
of
Media
was
a
result
of
what
is
called
the
Persian
Revolt
.
The
brouhaha
was
initially
triggered
by
the
actions
of
the
Median
ruler
Astyages
,
and
was
quickly
spread
to
other
provinces
,
as
they
allied
with
the
Persians
.
Later
conquests
under
Cyrus
and
his
successors
expanded
the
empire
to
include
Lydia
,
Babylon
,
Egypt
,
parts
of
the
Balkans
and
Eastern
Europe
proper
,
as
well
as
the
lands
to
the
west
of
the
Indus
and
Oxus
rivers
.
At
its
greatest
extent
,
the
Achaemenid
Empire
included
the
modern
territories
of
Iran
,
Azerbaijan
,
Armenia
,
Georgia
,
Turkey
,
much
of
the
Black
Sea
coastal
regions
,
northeastern
Greece
and
southern
Bulgaria
(
Thrace
)
,
northern
Greece
and
Macedonia
(
Paeonia
and
Ancient
Macedon
)
,
Iraq
,
Syria
,
Lebanon
,
Jordan
,
Israel
,
Palestine
,
all
significant
ancient
population
centers
of
ancient
Egypt
as
far
west
as
Libya
,
Kuwait
,
northern
Saudi
Arabia
,
parts
of
the
UAE
and
Oman
,
Pakistan
,
Afghanistan
,
and
much
of
Central
Asia
,
making
it
the
first
world
government
and
the
largest
empire
the
world
had
yet
seen
.
It
is
estimated
that
in
480
BC
,
50
million
people
lived
in
the
Achaemenid
Empire
.
The
empire
at
its
peak
ruled
over
44
%
of
the
world
's
population
,
the
highest
such
figure
for
any
empire
in
history
.
In
Greek
history
,
the
Achaemenid
Empire
is
considered
as
the
antagonist
of
the
Greek
city
states
,
for
the
emancipation
of
slaves
including
the
Jewish
exiles
in
Babylon
,
building
infrastructures
such
as
road
and
postal
systems
,
and
the
use
of
an
official
language
,
the
Imperial
Aramaic
,
throughout
its
territories
.
The
empire
had
a
centralized
,
bureaucratic
administration
under
the
emperor
,
a
large
professional
army
,
and
civil
services
,
inspiring
similar
developments
in
later
empires
.
Furthermore
,
one
of
the
Seven
Wonders
of
the
Ancient
World
,
the
Mausoleum
at
Halicarnassus
,
was
built
in
the
empire
between
353
and
350
BC
.
In
334
BC
,
Alexander
the
Great
invaded
the
Achaemenid
Empire
,
defeating
the
last
Achaemenid
emperor
,
Darius
III
,
at
the
Battle
of
Issus
.
Following
the
premature
death
of
Alexander
,
Iran
came
under
the
control
of
the
Hellenistic
Seleucid
Empire
.
In
the
middle
of
the
2nd
century
BC
,
the
Parthian
Empire
rose
to
become
the
main
power
in
Iran
,
and
the
century
-
long
geopolitical
arch-rivalry
between
Romans
and
Parthians
began
,
culminating
in
the
Roman
–Parthian
Wars
.
The
Parthian
Empire
continued
as
a
feudal
monarchy
for
nearly
five
centuries
,
until
224
CE
,
when
it
was
succeeded
by
the
Sassanid
Empire
.
Together
with
their
neighboring
arch-rival
,
the
Roman-
Byzantines
,
they
made
up
the
world
's
two
most
dominant
powers
at
the
time
,
for
over
four
centuries
.
The
prolonged
Byzantine
-Sassanid
Wars
,
most
importantly
the
climactic
Byzantine
-
Sassanid
War
of
602-628
,
as
well
as
the
social
conflict
within
the
Sassanid
Empire
,
opened
the
way
for
an
Arab
invasion
to
Iran
in
the
7th
century
.
Initially
defeated
by
the
Arab
Rashidun
Caliphate
,
Iran
came
under
the
rule
of
the
Arab
caliphates
of
Umayyad
and
Abbasid
.
The
prolonged
and
gradual
process
of
the
Islamization
of
Iran
began
following
the
conquest
.
Under
the
new
Arab
elite
of
the
Rashidun
and
later
the
Umayyad
caliphates
,
both
converted
(
mawali
)
and
non-converted
(
dhimmi
)
Iranians
were
discriminated
against
,
being
excluded
from
the
government
and
military
,
and
having
to
pay
a
special
tax
called
Jizya
.
Gunde
Shapur
,
home
of
the
Academy
of
Gunde
Shapur
which
was
the
most
important
medical
center
of
the
world
at
the
time
,
survived
after
the
invasion
,
but
became
known
as
an
Islamic
institute
thereafter
.
The
blossoming
literature
,
philosophy
,
medicine
,
and
art
of
Iran
became
major
elements
in
the
formation
of
a
new
age
for
the
Iranian
civilization
,
during
the
period
known
as
the
Islamic
Golden
Age
.
The
Islamic
Golden
Age
reached
its
peak
by
the
10th
and
11th
centuries
,
during
which
Iran
was
the
main
theater
of
the
scientific
activities
.
After
the
10th
century
,
Persian
language
,
alongside
Arabic
,
was
used
for
the
scientific
,
philosophical
,
historical
,
musical
,
and
medical
works
,
whereas
the
important
Iranian
writers
,
such
as
Tusi
,
Avicenna
,
Qotb
od
Din
Shirazi
,
and
Biruni
,
had
major
contributions
in
the
scientific
writing
.
The
10th
century
saw
a
mass
migration
of
Turkic
tribes
from
Central
Asia
into
the
Iranian
plateau
.
Turkic
tribesmen
were
first
used
in
the
Abbasid
army
as
mamluks
(
slave-warriors
)
,
replacing
Iranian
and
Arab
elements
within
the
army
.
As
a
result
,
the
mamluks
gained
a
significant
political
power
.
In
999
,
large
portions
of
Iran
came
briefly
under
the
rule
of
the
Ghaznavids
,
whose
rulers
were
of
mamluk
Turk
origin
,
and
longer
subsequently
under
the
Turkish
Seljuk
and
Khwarezmian
empires
.
These
Turks
had
been
Persianized
and
had
adopted
Persian
models
of
administration
and
rulership
.
The
Seljuks
subsequently
gave
rise
to
the
Sultanate
of
Rum
in
Anatolia
,
while
taking
their
thoroughly
Persianized
identity
with
them
.
The
result
of
the
adoption
and
patronage
of
Persian
culture
by
Turkish
rulers
was
the
development
of
a
distinct
Turko-Persian
tradition
.
Following
the
fracture
of
the
Mongol
Empire
in
1256
,
Hulagu
Khan
,
grandson
of
Genghis
Khan
,
established
the
Ilkhanate
in
Iran
.
In
1370
,
yet
another
conqueror
,
Timur
,
followed
the
example
of
Hulagu
,
establishing
the
Timurid
Empire
which
lasted
for
another
156
years
.
In
1387
,
Timur
ordered
the
complete
massacre
of
Isfahan
,
reportedly
killing
70,000
citizens
.
The
Ilkhans
and
the
Timurids
soon
came
to
adopt
the
ways
and
customs
of
the
Iranians
,
choosing
to
surround
themselves
with
a
culture
that
was
distinctively
Iranian
.
By
the
1500s
,
Ismail
I
from
Ardabil
,
established
the
Safavid
Dynasty
,
with
Tabriz
as
the
capital
.
Beginning
with
Azerbaijan
,
he
subsequently
extended
his
authority
over
all
of
the
Iranian
territories
,
and
established
an
intermittent
Iranian
hegemony
over
the
vast
relative
regions
,
reasserting
the
Iranian
identity
within
large
parts
of
the
Greater
Iran
.
Iran
was
predominantly
Sunni
,
but
Ismail
instigated
a
forced
conversion
to
the
Shia
branch
of
Islam
,
by
which
the
Shia
Islam
spread
throughout
the
Safavid
territories
in
the
Caucasus
,
Iran
,
Anatolia
,
and
Mesopotamia
.
As
a
result
,
thereof
,
the
modern-
day
Iran
is
the
only
official
Shia
nation
of
the
world
,
with
it
holding
an
absolute
majority
in
Iran
and
the
Republic
of
Azerbaijan
,
having
there
the
1st
and
2nd
highest
number
of
Shia
inhabitants
by
population
percentage
in
the
world
.
The
centuries
-long
geopolitical
and
ideological
rivalry
between
Safavid
Iran
and
the
neighboring
Ottoman
Empire
,
led
to
numerous
Ottoman
–Persian
Wars
.
The
Safavid
Era
peaked
in
the
reign
of
Abbas
the
Great
,
1587
–
1629
,
surpassing
their
Ottoman
arch
rivals
in
strength
,
and
making
the
empire
a
leading
hub
in
Western
Eurasia
for
the
sciences
and
arts
.
The
Safavid
Era
saw
the
start
of
mass
integration
from
Caucasian
populations
into
new
layers
of
the
society
of
Iran
,
as
well
as
mass
resettlement
of
them
within
the
heartlands
of
Iran
,
playing
a
pivotal
role
in
the
history
of
Iran
for
centuries
onwards
.
Following
a
gradual
decline
in
the
late
1600s
and
early
1700s
,
which
was
caused
by
the
internal
conflicts
,
the
continuous
wars
with
the
Ottomans
,
and
the
foreign
interference
(
most
notably
the
Russian
interference
)
,
the
Safavid
rule
was
ended
by
the
Pashtun
rebels
who
besieged
Isfahan
and
defeated
Soltan
Hosein
in
1722
.
In
1729
,
Nader
Shah
,
a
chieftain
and
military
genius
from
Khorasan
,
successfully
drove
out
and
conquered
the
Pashtun
invaders
.
He
subsequently
took
back
the
annexed
Caucasian
territories
which
were
divided
among
the
Ottoman
and
Russian
authorities
by
the
ongoing
chaos
in
Iran
.
During
the
reign
of
Nader
Shah
,
Iran
reached
its
greatest
extent
since
the
Sassanid
Empire
,
reestablishing
the
Iranian
hegemony
all
over
the
Caucasus
,
as
well
as
other
major
parts
of
the
west
and
central
Asia
,
and
briefly
possessing
what
was
arguably
the
most
powerful
empire
at
the
time
.
Another
civil
war
ensued
after
the
death
of
Karim
Khan
in
1779
,
out
of
which
Aqa
Mohammad
Khan
emerged
,
founding
the
Qajar
Dynasty
in
1794
.
In
1795
,
following
the
disobedience
of
the
Georgian
subjects
and
their
alliance
with
the
Russians
,
the
Qajars
captured
Tblisi
by
the
Battle
of
Krtsanisi
,
and
drove
the
Russians
out
of
the
entire
Caucasus
,
reestablishing
a
short-
lived
Iranian
suzerainty
over
the
region
.
The
Russo-Persian
wars
of
1804
–
1813
and
1826
–
1828
resulted
in
large
irrevocable
territorial
losses
for
Iran
in
the
Caucasus
,
comprising
all
of
Transcaucasia
and
Dagestan
,
which
made
part
of
the
very
concept
of
Iran
for
centuries
,
and
thus
substantial
gains
for
the
neighboring
Russian
Empire
.
As
a
result
of
the
19th
century
Russo-Persian
wars
,
the
Russians
took
over
the
Caucasus
,
and
Iran
irrevocably
lost
control
over
its
integral
territories
in
the
region
(
comprising
modern-
day
Dagestan
,
Georgia
,
Armenia
,
and
Azerbaijan
)
,
which
got
confirmed
per
the
treaties
of
Gulistan
and
Turkmenchay
.
The
area
to
the
north
of
the
river
Aras
,
among
which
the
contemporary
Republic
of
Azerbaijan
,
eastern
Georgia
,
Dagestan
,
and
Armenia
,
were
Iranian
territory
until
they
were
occupied
by
Russia
in
the
course
of
the
19th
century
.
Between
1872
and
1905
,
a
series
of
protests
took
place
in
response
to
the
sale
of
concessions
to
foreigners
by
Nasser
od
Din
and
Mozaffar
od
Din
shahs
of
Qajar
,
and
led
to
the
Iranian
Constitutional
Revolution
.
The
first
Iranian
Constitution
and
the
first
national
parliament
of
Iran
were
founded
in
1906
,
through
the
ongoing
revolution
.
The
Constitution
included
the
official
recognition
of
Iran
's
three
religious
minorities
,
namely
Christians
,
Zoroastrians
,
and
Jews
,
which
has
remained
a
basis
in
the
legislation
of
Iran
since
then
.
The
struggle
related
to
the
constitutional
movement
continued
until
1911
,
when
Mohammad
Ali
Shah
was
defeated
and
forced
to
abdicate
.
On
the
pretext
of
restoring
order
,
the
Russians
occupied
Northern
Iran
in
1911
,
and
maintained
a
military
presence
in
the
region
for
years
to
come
.
During
World
War
I
,
the
British
occupied
much
of
Western
Iran
,
and
fully
withdrew
in
1921
.
The
Persian
Campaign
commenced
furthermore
during
World
War
I
in
Northwestern
Iran
after
an
Ottoman
invasion
,
as
part
of
the
Middle
Eastern
Theatre
of
World
War
I
.
As
a
result
of
Ottoman
hostilities
across
the
border
,
a
large
amount
of
the
Assyrians
of
Iran
were
massacred
by
the
Ottoman
armies
,
notably
in
and
around
Urmia
.
Apart
from
the
rule
of
Aqa
Mohammad
Khan
,
the
Qajar
rule
is
characterized
as
a
century
of
misrule
.
In
1941
,
Reza
Shah
was
forced
to
abdicate
in
favor
of
his
son
,
Mohammad
Reza
Pahlavi
,
and
established
the
Persian
Corridor
,
a
massive
supply
route
that
would
last
until
the
end
of
the
ongoing
war
.
The
presence
of
so
many
foreign
troops
in
the
nation
also
culminated
in
the
Soviet
-
backed
establishment
of
two
puppet
regimes
in
the
nation
;
the
Azerbaijan
People
's
Government
,
and
the
Republic
of
Mahabad
.
As
the
Soviet
Union
refused
to
relinquish
the
occupied
Iranian
territory
,
the
Iran
crisis
of
1946
was
followed
,
which
particularly
resulted
in
the
dissolution
of
both
puppet
states
,
and
the
withdrawal
of
the
Soviets
.
Due
to
the
1973
spike
in
oil
prices
,
the
economy
of
Iran
was
flooded
with
foreign
currency
,
which
caused
inflation
.
By
1974
,
the
economy
of
Iran
was
experiencing
double
digit
inflation
,
and
despite
many
large
projects
to
modernize
the
country
,
corruption
was
rampant
and
caused
large
amounts
of
waste
.
By
1975
and
1976
,
an
economic
recession
led
to
increased
unemployment
,
especially
among
millions
of
youth
who
had
migrated
to
the
cities
of
Iran
looking
for
construction
jobs
during
the
boom
years
of
the
early
1970s
.
By
the
late
1970s
,
many
of
these
people
opposed
the
Shah
's
regime
and
began
to
organize
and
join
the
protests
against
it
.
The
immediate
nationwide
uprisings
against
the
new
government
began
by
the
1979
Kurdish
rebellion
with
the
Khuzestan
uprisings
,
along
with
the
uprisings
in
Sistan
and
Baluchestan
Province
and
other
areas
.
Over
the
next
several
years
,
these
uprisings
were
subdued
in
a
violent
manner
by
the
new
Islamic
government
.
The
new
government
went
about
purging
itself
of
the
non-Islamist
political
opposition
.
Although
both
nationalists
and
Marxists
had
initially
joined
with
Islamists
to
overthrow
the
Shah
,
tens
of
thousands
were
executed
by
the
Islamic
government
afterward
.
On
November
4
,
1979
,
a
group
of
students
seized
the
United
States
Embassy
and
took
the
embassy
with
52
personnel
and
citizens
hostage
,
after
the
United
States
refused
to
return
Mohammad
Reza
Pahlavi
to
Iran
to
face
trial
in
the
court
of
the
new
regime
.
Attempts
by
the
Jimmy
Carter
administration
to
negotiate
for
the
release
of
the
hostages
,
and
a
failed
rescue
attempt
,
helped
force
Carter
out
of
office
and
brought
Ronald
Reagan
to
power
.
On
Jimmy
Carter
's
final
day
in
office
,
the
last
hostages
were
finally
set
free
as
a
result
of
the
Algiers
Accords
.
On
September
22
,
1980
,
the
Iraqi
army
invaded
the
Iranian
Khuzestan
,
and
the
Iran
–Iraq
War
began
.
Although
the
forces
of
Saddam
Hussein
made
several
early
advances
,
by
mid
1982
,
the
Iranian
forces
successfully
managed
to
drive
the
Iraqi
army
back
into
Iraq
.
In
July
1982
,
with
Iraq
thrown
on
the
defensive
,
Iran
took
the
decision
to
invade
Iraq
and
conducted
countless
offensives
in
a
bid
to
conquer
Iraqi
territory
and
capture
cities
,
such
as
Basra
.
The
war
continued
until
1988
,
when
the
Iraqi
army
defeated
the
Iranian
forces
inside
Iraq
and
pushed
the
remaining
Iranian
troops
back
across
the
border
.
Subsequently
,
Khomeini
accepted
a
truce
mediated
by
the
UN
.
The
total
Iranian
casualties
in
the
war
were
estimated
to
be
123,220
–160,000
KIA
,
60,711
MIA
,
and
11,000
–
16,000
civilians
killed
.

Iran
consists
of
the
Iranian
Plateau
with
the
exception
of
the
coasts
of
the
Caspian
Sea
and
Khuzestan
Province
.
It
is
one
of
the
world
's
most
mountainous
countries
,
its
landscape
dominated
by
rugged
mountain
ranges
that
separate
various
basins
or
plateaux
from
one
another
.
The
populous
western
part
is
the
most
mountainous
,
with
ranges
such
as
the
Caucasus
,
Zagros
and
Alborz
Mountains
;
the
last
contains
Iran
's
highest
point
,
Mount
Damavand
at

,
which
is
also
the

Iran
's
climate
ranges
from
arid

Gary
Lewis
has
said
that
"
Water

"
.
To
the

basin
experience
lower
temperatures
,
severe
winters
with
below
zero
average

74
species
of
Iranian
wildlife
are
on
the
red

for
the
Conservation
of
Nature
,
a
sign
of
serious
threats
against
the
country
’s
biodiversity
.
The
Iranian
Parliament
has
been
showing
disregard
for
wildlife
by
passing
laws
and
regulations
such
as
the
act
that
lets
the
Ministry
of
Industries
and
Mines
exploit
mines
without
the
involvement
of

Shiraz
,
with
a
population
of
around
1.4
million
(
2011
census
)
,
is
the
sixth
major
city
of
Iran
.
It
is
the
capital
of
Fars
Province
,
and
was
also
a
former
capital
of
Iran
.
The
area
was
greatly
influenced
by
the
Babylonian
civilization
,
and
after
the
emergence
of
the
ancient
Persians
,
soon
came
to
be
known
as
Persis
.
Persians
were
present
in
the
region
since
the
9th
century
BC
,
and
became
rulers
of
a
large
empire
under
the
reign
of
the
Achaemenid
Dynasty
in
the
6th
century
BC
.
The
ruins
of
Persepolis
and
Pasargadae
,
two
of
the
four
capitals
of
the
Achaemenid
Empire
,
are
located
around
the
modern
-
day
city
of
Shiraz
.
The
political
system
of
the
Islamic
Republic
is
based
on
the
1979
Constitution
,
and
comprises
several
intricately
connected
governing
bodies
.
The
Leader
of
the
Revolution
(
"
Supreme
Leader
"
)
is
responsible
for
delineation
and
supervision
of
the
general
policies
of
the
Islamic
Republic
of
Iran
.
The
Supreme
Leader
is
Commander-

Since
2005
,
Iran
's
nuclear
program
has
become
the
subject
of
contention
with
the
international
community
following
earlier
quotes
of
Iranian
leadership
favoring
the
use
of
an
atomic
bomb
against
Iran
's
enemies
and
in
particular
Israel
.
Many
countries
have
expressed
concern
that
Iran
's
nuclear
program
could
divert
civilian
nuclear
technology
into
a
weapons
program
.
This
has
led
the
UN
Security
Council
to
impose
sanctions
against
Iran
which
had
further
isolated
Iran
politically
and
economically
from
the
rest
of
the
global
community
.
In
2009
,
the
US
Director
of
National
Intelligence
said
that
Iran
,
if
choosing
to
,
would
not
be
able
to
develop
a
nuclear
weapon
until
2013
.
Iran
has
a
paramilitary
,
volunteer
militia
force
within
the
IRGC
,
called
the
Basij
,
which
includes
about
90,000
full-time
,
active-duty
uniformed
members
.
Up
to
11
million
men
and
women
are
members
of
the
Basij
who
could
potentially
be
called
up
for
service
;
GlobalSecurity.org
estimates
Iran
could
mobilize
"
up
to
one
million
men
"
.
This
would
be
among
the
largest
troop
mobilizations
in
the
world
.
In
2007
,
Iran
's
military
spending
represented
2.6
%
of
the
GDP
or
$
102
per
capita
,
the
lowest
figure
of
the
Persian
Gulf
nations
.
Iran
's
military
doctrine
is
based
on
deterrence
.
In
2014
arms
spending
the
country
spent
$
15
billion
and
was
outspent
by
the
states
of
the
Gulf
Cooperation
Council
by
a
factor
of
13
.
Since
the
1979
Revolution
,
to
overcome
foreign
embargoes
,
Iran
has
developed
its
own
military
industry
,
produced
its
own
tanks
,
armored
personnel
carriers
,
guided
missiles
,
submarines
,
military
vessels
,
guided
missile
destroyer
,
radar
systems
,
helicopters
and
fighter
planes
.
In
recent
years
,
official
announcements
have
highlighted
the
development
of
weapons
such
as
the
Hoot
,
Kowsar
,
Zelzal
,
Fateh
-
110
,
Shahab
-
3
and
Sejjil
missiles
,
and
a
variety
of
unmanned
aerial
vehicles
(
UAVs
)
.
The
Fajr
-
3
(
MIRV
)
is
currently
Iran
's
most
advanced
ballistic
missile
,
it
is
a
liquid
fuel
missile
with
an
undisclosed
range
which
was
developed
and
produced
domestically
.
In
2006
,
about
45
%
of
the
government
's
budget
came
from
oil
and
natural
gas
revenues
,
and
31
%
came
from
taxes
and
fees
.
As
of
2007
[
update
]
,
Iran
had
earned
$
70
billion
in
foreign
exchange
reserves
mostly
(
80
%
)
from
crude
oil
exports
.
Iranian
budget
deficits
have
been
a
chronic
problem
,
mostly
due
to
large-scale
state
subsidies
,
that
include
foodstuffs
and
especially
gasoline
,
totaling
more
than
$
84
billion
in
2008
for
the
energy
sector
alone
.
In
2010
,
the
economic
reform
plan
was
approved
by
parliament
to
cut
subsidies
gradually
and
replace
them
with
targeted
social
assistance
.
The
objective
is
to
move
towards
free
market
prices
in
a
5
-
year
period
and
increase
productivity
and
social
justice
.
The
administration
continues
to
follow
the
market
reform
plans
of
the
previous
one
and
indicated
that
it
will
diversify
Iran
's
oil-reliant
economy
.
Iran
has
also
developed
a
biotechnology
,
nanotechnology
,
and
pharmaceuticals
industry
.
However
,
nationalized
industries
such
as
the
bonyads
have
often
been
managed
badly
,
making
them
ineffective
and
uncompetitive
with
years
.
Currently
,
the
government
is
trying
to
privatize
these
industries
,
and
,
despite
successes
,
there
are
still
several
problems
to
be
overcome
,
such
as
the
lagging
corruption
in
the
public
sector
and
lack
of
competitiveness
.
In
2010
,
Iran
was
ranked
69
,
out
of
139
nations
,
in
the
Global
Competitiveness
Report
.
Economic
sanctions
against
Iran
,
such
as
the
embargo
against
Iranian
crude
oil
,
have
affected
the
economy
.
Sanctions
have
led
to
a
steep
fall
in
the
value
of
the
rial
,
and
as
of
April
2013
one
US
dollar
is
worth
36,000
rial
,
compared
with
16,000
in
early
2012
.
Following
a
successful
implementation
of
the
2015
nuclear
and
sanctions
relief
deal
,
the
resulting
benefits
might
not
be
distributed
evenly
across
the
Iranian
economy
as
political
elites
such
as
the
Islamic
Revolutionary
Guard
Corps
have
garnered
more
resources
and
economic
interests
.
Alongside
the
capital
,
the
most
popular
tourist
destinations
are
Isfahan
,
Mashhad
and
Shiraz
.
In
the
early
2000s
,
the
industry
faced
serious
limitations
in
infrastructure
,
communications
,
industry
standards
and
personnel
training
.
The
majority
of
the
300,000
tourist
visas
granted
in
2003
were
obtained
by
Asian
Muslims
,
who
presumably
intended
to
visit
important
pilgrimage
sites
in
Mashhad
and
Qom.
Several
organized
tours
from
Germany
,
France
and
other
European
countries
come
to
Iran
annually
to
visit
archaeological
sites
and
monuments
.
In
2003
,
Iran
ranked
68th
in
tourism
revenues
worldwide
.
According
to
UNESCO
and
the
deputy
head
of
research
for
Iran
Travel
and
Tourism
Organization
(
ITTO
)
,
Iran
is
rated
4th
among
the
top
10
destinations
in
the
Middle
East
.
Domestic
tourism
in
Iran
is
one
of
the
largest
in
the
world
.
Weak
advertising
,
unstable
regional
conditions
,
a
poor
public
image
in
some
parts
of
the
world
,
and
absence
of
efficient
planning
schemes
in
the
tourism
sector
have
all
hindered
the
growth
of
tourism
.
Iran
has
the
second
largest
proved
gas
reserves
in
the
world
after
Russia
,
with
33.6
trillion
cubic
metres
,
and
third
largest
natural
gas
production
in
the
world
after
Indonesia
,
and
Russia
.
It
also
ranks
fourth
in
oil
reserves
with
an
estimated
153,600,000,000
barrels
.
It
is
OPEC
's
2nd
largest
oil
exporter
and
is
an
energy
superpower
.
In
2005
,
Iran
spent
US
$
4
billion
on
fuel
imports
,
because
of
contraband
and
inefficient
domestic
use
.
Oil
industry
output
averaged
4
million
barrels
per
day
(
640,000
m
3/d
)
in
2005
,
compared
with
the
peak
of
six
million
barrels
per
day
reached
in
1974
.
In
the
early
years
of
the
2000s
(
decade
)
,
industry
infrastructure
was
increasingly
inefficient
because
of
technological
lags
.
Few
exploratory
wells
were
drilled
in
2005
.
In
2004
,
a
large
share
of
natural
gas
reserves
in
Iran
were
untapped
.
The
addition
of
new
hydroelectric
stations
and
the
streamlining
of
conventional
coal
and
oil-fired
stations
increased
installed
capacity
to
33,000
megawatts
.
Of
that
amount
,
about
75
%
was
based
on
natural
gas
,
18
%
on
oil
,
and
7
%
on
hydroelectric
power
.
In
2004
,
Iran
opened
its
first
wind
-powered
and
geothermal
plants
,
and
the
first
solar
thermal
plant
is
to
come
online
in
2009
.
Iran
is
the
third
country
in
the
world
to
have
developed
GTL
technology
.
Iranian
scientists
outside
Iran
have
also
made
some
major
contributions
to
science
.
In
1960
,
Ali
Javan
co-invented
the
first
gas
laser
,
and
fuzzy
set
theory
was
introduced
by
Lotfi
Zadeh
.
Iranian
cardiologist
,
Tofy
Mussivand
invented
and
developed
the
first
artificial
cardiac
pump
,
the
precursor
of
the
artificial
heart
.
Furthering
research
and
treatment
of
diabetes
,
HbA1c
was
discovered
by
Samuel
Rahbar
.
Iranian
physics
is
especially
strong
in
string
theory
,
with
many
papers
being
published
in
Iran
.
Iranian
-American
string
theorist
Kamran
Vafa
proposed
the
Vafa-Witten
theorem
together
with
Edward
Witten
.
In
August
2014
,
Maryam
Mirzakhani
became
the
first-ever
woman
,
as
well
as
the
first-ever
Iranian
,
to
receive
the
Fields
Medal
,
the
highest
prize
in
mathematics
.
As
with
the
spoken
languages
,
the
ethnic
group
composition
also
remains
a
point
of
debate
,
mainly
regarding
the
largest
and
second
largest
ethnic
groups
,
the
Persians
and
Azerbaijanis
,
due
to
the
lack
of
Iranian
state
censuses
based
on
ethnicity
.
The
CIA's
World
Factbook
has
estimated
that
around
79
%
of
the
population
of
Iran
are
a
diverse
Indo-European
ethno-linguistic
group
that
comprise
the
speakers
of
Iranian
languages
,
with
Persians
constituting
53
%
of
the
population
,
Gilaks
and
Mazanderanis
7
%
,
Kurds
10
%
,
Lurs
6
%
,
and
Balochs
2
%
.
Peoples
of
the
other
ethnicities
in
Iran
make
up
the
remaining
22
%
,
with
Azerbaijanis
constituting
16
%
,
Arabs
2
%
,
Turkmens
and
Turkic
tribes
2
%
,
and
others
2
%
(
such
as
Armenians
,
Talysh
,
Georgians
,
Circassians
,
Assyrians
)
.
Christianity
,
Judaism
,
Zoroastrianism
,
and
the
Sunni
branch
of
Islam
are
officially
recognized
by
the
government
,
and
have
reserved
seats
in
the
Iranian
Parliament
.
But
the
Bahá'í
Faith
,
which
is
said
to
be
the
largest
non-Muslim
religious
minority
in
Iran
,
is
not
officially
recognized
,
and
has
been
persecuted
during
its
existence
in
Iran
since
the
19th
century
.
Since
the
1979
Revolution
,
the
persecution
of
Bahais
has
increased
with
executions
,
the
denial
of
civil
rights
and
liberties
,
and
the
denial
of
access
to
higher
education
and
employment
.
The
earliest
examples
of
visual
representations
in
Iranian
history
are
traced
back
to
the
bas-reliefs
of
Persepolis
,
c.
500
BC
.
Persepolis
was
the
ritual
center
of
the
ancient
kingdom
of
Achaemenids
,
and
the
figures
at
Persepolis
remain
bound
by
the
rules
of
grammar
and
syntax
of
visual
language
.
The
Iranian
visual
arts
reached
a
pinnacle
by
the
Sassanid
Era
.
A
bas-relief
from
this
period
in
Taq
Bostan
depicts
a
complex
hunting
scene
.
Similar
works
from
the
period
have
been
found
to
articulate
movements
and
actions
in
a
highly
sophisticated
manner
.
It
is
even
possible
to
see
a
progenitor
of
the
cinema
close
-
up
in
one
of
these
works
of
art
,
which
shows
a
wounded
wild
pig
escaping
from
the
hunting
ground
.
The
1960s
was
a
significant
decade
for
Iranian
cinema
,
with
25
commercial
films
produced
annually
on
average
throughout
the
early
60s
,
increasing
to
65
by
the
end
of
the
decade
.
The
majority
of
production
focused
on
melodrama
and
thrillers
.
With
the
screening
of
the
films
Kaiser
and
The
Cow
,
directed
by
Masoud
Kimiai
and
Dariush
Mehrjui
respectively
in
1969
,
alternative
films
established
their
status
in
the
film
industry
.
Attempts
to
organize
a
film
festival
that
had
begun
in
1954
within
the
framework
of
the
Golrizan
Festival
,
bore
fruits
in
the
form
of
the
Sepas
Festival
in
1969
.
The
endeavors
also
resulted
in
the
formation
of
the
Tehran
World
Festival
in
1973
.
After
the
Revolution
of
1979
,
as
the
new
government
imposed
new
laws
and
standards
,
a
new
age
in
Iranian
cinema
emerged
,
starting
with
Viva
...
by
Khosrow
Sinai
and
followed
by
many
other
directors
,
such
as
Abbas
Kiarostami
and
Jafar
Panahi
.
Kiarostami
,
an
admired
Iranian
director
,
planted
Iran
firmly
on
the
map
of
world
cinema
when
he
won
the
Palme
d'
Or
for
Taste
of
Cherry
in
1997
.
The
continuous
presence
of
Iranian
films
in
prestigious
international
festivals
,
such
as
the
Cannes
Film
Festival
,
the
Venice
Film
Festival
,
and
the
Berlin
International
Film
Festival
,
attracted
world
attention
to
Iranian
masterpieces
.
In
2006
,
six
Iranian
films
,
of
six
different
styles
,
represented
Iranian
cinema
at
the
Berlin
International
Film
Festival
.
Critics
considered
this
a
remarkable
event
in
the
history
of
Iranian
cinema
.
Iran
received
access
to
the
Internet
in
1993
.
According
to
2014
census
,
around
40
%
of
the
population
of
Iran
are
Internet
users
.
Iran
ranks
24th
among
countries
by
number
of
Internet
users
.
According
to
the
statistics
provided
by
the
web
information
company
of
Alexa
,
Google
Search
and
Yahoo
!
are
the
most
used
search
engines
in
Iran
.
Over
80
%
of
the
users
of
Telegram
,
a
cloud-
based
instant
messaging
service
,
are
from
Iran
.
Instagram
is
the
most
popular
online
social
networking
service
in
Iran
.
Direct
access
to
Facebook
has
been
blocked
in
Iran
since
the
2009
Iranian
presidential
election
protests
,
due
to
organization
of
the
opposition
movements
on
the
website
;
but
however
,
Facebook
has
around
12
to
17
million
users
in
Iran
who
are
using
virtual
private
networks
and
proxy
servers
to
access
the
website
.
Around
90
%
of
Iran
's
e-commerce
takes

of
Digikala
,
which
has
around
750,000

and
more
than
2.3
million

.
Iranian
cuisine
is
diverse
due
to
its
variety
of
ethnic
groups
and
the
influence
of
other
cultures
.
Herbs
are
frequently
used
along
with
fruits
such
as
plums
,
pomegranates
,
quince
,
prunes
,
apricots
,
and
raisins
.
Iranians
usually
eat
plain
yogurt
with
lunch
and
dinner
;
it
is
a
staple
of
the
diet
in
Iran
.
To
achieve
a
balanced
taste
,
characteristic
flavourings
such
as
saffron
,
dried
limes
,
cinnamon
,
and
parsley
are
mixed
delicately
and
used
in
some
special
dishes
.
Onions
and
garlic
are
normally
used
in
the
preparation
of
the
accompanying
course
,
but
are
also
served
separately
during
meals
,
either
in
raw
or
pickled
form
.
Iran
is
also
famous
for
its
caviar
.
Other
non-governmental
estimations
regarding
the
groups
other
than
the
Persians
and
Azerbaijanis
roughly
congruate
with
the
World
Factbook
and
the
Library
of
Congress
.
However
,
many
scholarly
and
organisational
estimations
regarding
the
number
of
these
two
groups
differ
significantly
from
the
mentioned
census
.
According
to
many
of
them
,
the
number
of
ethnic
Azerbaijanis
in
Iran
comprises
between
21.6–30
%
of
the
total
population
,
with
the
majority
holding
it
on
25
%
.cd
In
any
case
,
the
largest
population
of
Azerbaijanis
in
the
world
live
in
Iran
.
Iran
has
leading
manufacturing
industries
in
the
fields
of
car-manufacture
and
transportation
,
construction
materials
,
home
appliances
,
food
and
agricultural
goods
,
armaments
,
pharmaceuticals
,
information
technology
,
power
and
petrochemicals
in
the
Middle
East
.
According
to
FAO
,
Iran
has
been
a
top
five
producer
of
the
following
agricultural
products
in
the
world
in
2012
:
apricots
,
cherries
,
sour
cherries
,
cucumbers
and
gherkins
,
dates
,
eggplants
,
figs
,
pistachios
,
quinces
,
walnuts
,
and
watermelons
.
Iranian
art
encompasses
many
disciplines
,
including
architecture
,
painting
,
weaving
,
pottery
,
calligraphy
,
metalworking
,
and
stonemasonry
.
The
Median
and
Achaemenid
empires
left
a
significant
classical
art
scene
which
remained
as
basic
influences
for
the
art
of
the
later
eras
.
Art
of
the
Parthians
was
a
mixture
of
Iranian
and
Hellenistic
artworks
,
with
their
main
motifs
being
scenes
of
royal
hunting
expeditions
and
investitures
.
The
Sassanid
art
played
a
prominent
role
in
the
formation
of
both
European
and
Asian
medieval
art
,
which
carried
forward
to
the
Islamic
world
,
and
much
of
what
later
became
known
as
Islamic
learning
,
such
as
philology
,
literature
,
jurisprudence
,
philosophy
,
medicine
,
architecture
,
and
science
,
were
of
Sassanid
basis
.
Brasília
(
Portuguese
pronunciation
:
[
bɾaˈziljɐ
]
)
is
the
federal
capital
of
Brazil
and
seat
of
government
of
the
Federal
District
.
The
city
is
located
atop
the
Brazilian
highlands
in
the
country
's
center-western
region
.
It
was
founded
on
April
21
,
1960
,
to
serve
as
the
new
national
capital
.
Brasília
and
its
metro
(
encompassing
the
whole
of
the
Federal
District
)
had
a
population
of
2,556,149
in
2011
,
making
it
the
4th
most
populous
city
in
Brazil
.
Among
major
Latin
American
cities
,
Brasília
has
the
highest
GDP
per
capita
at
R$
61,915
(
US
$
36,175
)
.
The
city
has
a
unique
status
in
Brazil
,
as
it
is
an
administrative
division
rather
than
a
legal
municipality
like
other
cities
in
Brazil
.
The
name
'
Brasília
'
is
commonly
used
as
a
synonym
for
the
Federal
District
through
synecdoche
;
However
,
the
Federal
District
is
composed
of
31
administrative
regions
,
only
one
of
which
is
Brasília
proper
,
with
a
population
of
209,926
in
a
2011
survey
;
Demographic
publications
generally
do
not
make
this
distinction
and
list
the
population
of
Brasília
as
synonymous
with
the
population
of
the
Federal
District
,
considering
the
whole
of
it
as
its
metropolitan
area
.
The
city
was
one
of
the
main
host
cities
of
the
2014
FIFA
World
Cup
.
Additionally
,
Brasília
hosted
the
2013
FIFA
Confederations
Cup
.
Juscelino
Kubitschek
,
President
of
Brazil
from
1956
to
1961
,
ordered
the
construction
of
Brasília
,
fulfilling
the
promise
of
the
Constitution
and
his
own
political
campaign
promise
.
Building
Brasília
was
part
of
Juscelino
's
"
fifty
years
of
prosperity
in
five
"
plan
.
Lúcio
Costa
won
a
contest
and
was
the
main
urban
planner
in
1957
,
with
5550
people
competing
.
Oscar
Niemeyer
,
a
close
friend
,
was
the
chief
architect
of
most
public
buildings
and
Roberto
Burle
Marx
was
the
landscape
designer
.
Brasília
was
built
in
41
months
,
from
1956
to
April
21
,
1960
,
when
it
was
officially
inaugurated
.
Until
the
1980s
,
the
governor
of
the
Federal
District
was
appointed
by
the
Federal
Government
,
and
the
laws
of
Brasília
were
issued
by
the
Brazilian
Federal
Senate
.
With
the
Constitution
of
1988
Brasília
gained
the
right
to
elect
its
Governor
,
and
a
District
Assembly
(
Câmara
Legislativa
)
was
elected
to
exercise
legislative
power
.
The
Federal
District
does
not
have
a
Judicial
Power
of
its
own
.
The
Judicial
Power
which
serves
the
Federal
District
also
serves
federal
territories
.
Currently
,
Brazil
does
not
have
any
territories
,
therefore
,
for
now
the
courts
serve
only
cases
from
the
Federal
District
.
Brasília
has
a
tropical
savanna
climate
(
Aw
)
according
to
the
Köppen
system
,
with
two
distinct
seasons
:
the
rainy
season
,
from
October
to
April
,
and
a
dry
season
,
from
May
to
September
.
The
average
temperature
is
20.6
°C
(
69.1
°F
)
.
September
,
at
the
end
of
the
dry
season
,
has
the
highest
average
maximum
temperature
,
28.3
°C
(
82.9
°F
)
,
has
major
and
minor
lower
maximum
average

,
of
25.1
°C
(
77.2
°F
)
and
12.9
°C
(

)
,
respectively
.
Average
temperatures
from
September
through
March
are
a
consistent
22
°C
(

°F
)
.
With
247.4
mm
(

,
January
is
the
month
with
the
highest
rainfall
of
the
year
,
while
June
is
the
lowest
,
with
only
8.7

.
The
Portuguese
language
is
the
official
national
language
and
the
primary
language
taught
in
schools
.
English
and
Spanish
are
also
part
of
the
official
curriculum
.
The
city
has
six
international
schools
:
American
School
of
Brasília
,
Brasília

.
August
2016
will
see
the
opening
of
a
new
international

-
The
British

Brasília
has
two
universities
,
three
university

,
and
many
private
colleges
.
The
Cathedral
of
Brasília
in
the
capital
of
the
Federative
Republic
of
Brazil
,
is
an
expression
of
the
architect
Oscar
Niemeyer
.
This
concrete-framed
hyperboloid
structure
,
seems
with
its
glass
roof
reaching
up
,
open
,
to
the
heavens
.
On
31
May
1970
,
the
Cathedral
’s
structure
was
finished
,
and
only
the
70
m
(
229.66
ft
)
diameter
of
the
circular
area
were
visible
.
Niemeyer
's
project
of
Cathedral
of
Brasília
is
based
in
the
hyperboloid
of
revolution
which
sections
are
asymmetric
.
The
hyperboloid
structure
itself
is
a
result
of
16
identical
assembled
concrete
columns
.
These
columns
,
having
hyperbolic
section
and
weighing
90
t
,
represent
two
hands
moving
upwards
to
heaven
.
The
Cathedral
was
dedicated
on
31
May
1970
.
A
series
of
low-lying
annexes
(
largely
hidden
)
flank
both
ends
.
Also
in
the
square
are
the
glass-faced
Planalto
Palace
housing
the
presidential
offices
,
and
the
Palace
of
the
Supreme
Court
.
Farther
east
,
on
a
triangle
of
land
jutting
into
the
lake
,
is
the
Palace
of
the
Dawn
(
Palácio
da
Alvorada
;
the
presidential
residence
)
.
Between
the
federal
and
civic
buildings
on
the
Monumental
Axis
is
the
city
's
cathedral
,
considered
by
many
to
be
Niemeyer
's
finest
achievement
(
see
photographs
of
the
interior
)
.
The
parabolically
shaped
structure
is
characterized
by
its
16
gracefully
curving
supports
,
which
join
in
a
circle
115
feet
(
35
meters
)
above
the
floor
of
the
nave
;
stretched
between
the
supports
are
translucent
walls
of
tinted
glass
.
The
nave
is
entered
via
a
subterranean
passage
rather
than
conventional
doorways
.
Other
notable
buildings
are
Buriti
Palace
,
Itamaraty
Palace
,
the
National
Theater
,
and
several
foreign
embassies
that
creatively
embody
features
of
their
national
architecture
.
The
Brazilian
landscape
architect
Roberto
Burle
Marx
designed
landmark
modernist
gardens
for
some
of
the
principal
buildings
.
Both
low-cost
and
luxury
housing
were
built
by
the
government
in
the
Brasília
.
The
residential
zones
of
the
inner
city
are
arranged
into
superquadras
(
"
superblocks
"
)
:
groups
of
apartment
buildings
along
with
a
prescribed
number
and
type
of
schools
,
retail
stores
,
and
open
spaces
.
At
the
northern
end
of
Lake
Paranoá
,
separated
from
the
inner
city
,
is
a
peninsula
with
many
fashionable
homes
,
and
a
similar
city
exists
on
the
southern
lakeshore
.
Originally
the
city
planners
envisioned
extensive
public
areas
along
the
shores
of
the
artificial
lake
,
but
during
early
development
private
clubs
,
hotels
,
and
upscale
residences
and
restaurants
gained
footholds
around
the
water
.
Set
well
apart
from
the
city
are
satellite
cities
,
including
Gama
,
Ceilândia
,
Taguatinga
,
Núcleo
Bandeirante
,
Sobradinho
,
and
Planaltina
.
These
cities
,
with
the
exception
of
Gama
and
Sobradinho
were
not
planned
.
After
a
visit
to
Brasília
,
the
French
writer
Simone
de
Beauvoir
complained
that
all
of
its
superquadras
exuded
"
the
same
air
of
elegant
monotony
,
"
and
other
observers
have
equated
the
city
's
large
open
lawns
,
plazas
,
and
fields
to
wastelands
.
As
the
city
has
matured
,
some
of
these
have
gained
adornments
,
and
many
have
been
improved
by
landscaping
,
giving
some
observers
a
sense
of
"
humanized
"
spaciousness
.
Although
not
fully
accomplished
,
the
"
Brasília
utopia
"
has
produced
a
city
of
relatively
high
quality
of
life
,
in
which
the
citizens
live
in
forested
areas
with
sporting
and
leisure
structure
(
the
superquadras
)
flanked
by
small
commercial
areas
,
bookstores
and
cafes
;
the
city
is
famous
for
its
cuisine
and
efficiency
of
transit
.
The
major
roles
of
construction
and
of
services
(
government
,
communications
,
banking
and
finance
,
food
production
,
entertainment
,
and
legal
services
)
in
Brasília
's
economy
reflect
the
city
's
status
as
a
governmental
rather
than
an
industrial
center
.
Industries
connected
with
construction
,
food
processing
,
and
furnishings
are
important
,
as
are
those
associated
with
publishing
,
printing
,
and
computer
software
.

.
Besides
being
the
political
center
,
Brasília
is
an
important
economic
center
.
Brasília
has
the
highest
city
gross
domestic
product
(
GDP
)
of
99.5
billion
reais
representing
3.76
%
of
the
total
Brazilian
GDP
.
The
main
economic
activity
of
the
federal
capital
results
from
its
administrative
function
.
Its
industrial
planning
is
studied
carefully
by
the
Government
of
the
Federal
District
.
Being
a
city
registered
by
UNESCO
,
the
government
in
Brasília
has
opted
to
encourage
the
development
of
non-polluting
industries
such
as
software
,
film
,
video
,
and
gemology
among
others
,
with
emphasis
on
environmental
preservation
and
maintaining
ecological
balance
,
preserving
the
city
property
.
The
city
's
planned
design
included
specific
areas
for
almost
everything
,
including
accommodation
,
Hotels
Sectors
North
and
South
.
New
hotel
facilities
are
being
developed
elsewhere
,
such
as
the
hotels
and
tourism
Sector
North
,
located
on
the
shores
of
Lake
Paranoá
.
Brasília
has
a
range
of
tourist
accommodation
from
inns
,
pensions
and
hostels
to
larger
international
chain
hotels
.
The
city
's
restaurants
cater
to
a
wide
range
of
foods
from
local
and
regional
Brazilian
dishes
to
international
cuisine
.
Brasília
has
also
been
the
focus
of
modern
-
day
literature
.

from
the
late

where
an
artificial
lake

Praça
dos
Três
Poderes
(
Portuguese
for
Square
of
the
Three
Powers
)
is
a
plaza
in
Brasília
.
The
name
is
derived
from
the
encounter
of
the
three
federal
branches
around
the
plaza
:
the
Executive
,
represented
by
the
Palácio
do
Planalto
(
presidential
office
)
;
the
Legislative
,
represented
by
the
National
Congress
(
Congresso
Nacional
)
;
and
the
Judicial
branch
,
represented
by
the
Supreme
Federal
Court
(
Supremo
Tribunal
Federal
)
.
It
is
a
tourist
attraction
in
Brasília
,
designed
by
Lúcio
Costa
and
Oscar
Niemeyer
as
a
place
where
the
three
branches
would
meet
harmoniously
.
The
Palácio
da
Alvorada
is
the
official
residence
of
the
President
of
Brazil
.
The
palace
was
designed
,
along
with
the
rest
of
the
city
of
Brasília
,
by
Oscar
Niemeyer
and
inaugurated
in
1958
.
One
of
the
first
structures
built
in
the
republic
's
new
capital
city
,
the
"
Alvorada
"
lies
on
a
peninsula
at
the
margins
of
Lake
Paranoá
.
The
principles
of
simplicity
and
modernity
,
that
in
the
past
characterized
the
great
works
of
architecture
,
motivated
Niemeyer
.
The
viewer
has
an
impression
of
looking
at
a
glass
box
,
softly
landed
on
the
ground
with
the
support
of
thin
external
columns
.
The
building
has
an
area
of
7,000
m2
with
three
floors
consisting
of
the
basement
,
landing
,
and
second
floor
.
The
auditorium
,
kitchen
,
laundry
,
medical
center
,
and
administration
offices
are
at
basement
level
.
The
rooms
used
by
the
presidency
for
official
receptions
are
on
the
landing
.
The
second
floor
has
four
suites
,
two
apartments
,
and
various
private
rooms
which
make
up
the
residential
part
of
the
palace
.
The
building
also
has
a
library
,
a
heated
Olympic-sized
swimming
pool
,
a

the
official
workplace
of
the
President

As
the
seat
of
government
,
the
term
"
Planalto
"
is
often
used
as
a
metonym
for
the
executive
branch
of
government
.
The
main

office
of
the

Republic
is
in
the
Palácio
do
Planalto
.
The
President
and
his
or
her
family
do
not
live
in
it
,
rather
in
the
official
residence
,
the
Palácio
da
Alvorada
.
Besides
the
President
,
senior
advisors
also
have
offices
in
the
"
Planalto
,
"
including
the
Vice
-President
of
Brazil
and
the
Chief
of
Staff
.
The
other
Ministries
are
along
the
Esplanada
dos
Ministérios
.
The
architect
of
the
Palácio
do
Planalto
was
Oscar
Niemeyer
,
creator
of
most
of
the
important
buildings
in
Brasília
.
The
idea
was
to
project
an
image
of
simplicity
and
modernity
using
fine
lines
and
waves
to
compose
the
columns
and
exterior
structures
.
The
Palace
is
four
stories
high
,
and
has
an
area
of
36,000
m2
.
Four
other
adjacent
buildings
are
also
part
of
the
complex
.
This
makes
for
a
large
number
of
takeoffs
and
landings
and
it
is
not
unusual
for
flights
to
be
delayed
in
the
holding
pattern
before
landing
.
Following
the
airport
's
master
plan
,
Infraero
built
a
second
runway
,
which
was
finished
in
2006
.
In
2007
,
the
airport
handled
11,119,872
passengers
.
The
main
building
's
third
floor
,
with
12
thousand
square
meters
,
has
a
panoramic
deck
,
a
food
court
,
shops
,
four
movie
theatres
with
total
capacity
of
500
people
,
and
space
for
exhibitions
.
Brasília
Airport
has
136
vendor
spaces
.
The
airport
is
located
about
11
km
(
6.8
mi
)
from
the
central
area
of
Brasília
,
outside
the
metro
system
.
The
area
outside
the
airport
's
main
gate
is
lined
with
taxis
as
well
as
several
bus
line
services
which
connect
the
airport
to
Brasília
's
central
district
.
The
parking
lot
accommodates
1,200
cars
.
The
airport
is
serviced
by
domestic
and
regional
airlines
(
TAM
,
GOL
,
Azul
,
WebJET
,
Trip
and
Avianca
)
,
in
addition
to
a
number
of
international
carriers
.
In
2012
,
Brasília
's
International
Airport
was
won
by
the
InfrAmerica
consortium
,
formed
by
the
Brazilian
engineering
company
ENGEVIX
and
the
Argentine
Corporacion
America
holding
company
,
with
a
50
%
stake
each
.
During
the
25
-
year
concession
,
the
airport
may
be
expanded
to
up
to
40
million
passengers
a
year
.
In
2014
,
the
airport
received
15
new
boarding
bridges
,
totalling
28
in
all
.
This
was
the
main
requirement
made
by
the
federal
government
,
which
transferred
the
operation
of
the
terminal
to
the
Inframerica
Group
after
an
auction
.
The
group
invested
R$
750
million
in
the
project
.
In
the
same
year
,
the
number
of
parking
spaces
doubled
,
reaching
three
thousand
.
The
airport
's
entrance
have
a
new
rooftop
cover
and
a
new
access
road
.
Furthermore
,
a
VIP
room
was
created
on
Terminal
1's
third
floor
.
The
investments
resulted
an
increase
the
capacity
of
Brasília
's
airport
from
approximately
15
million
passengers
per
year
to
21
million
by
2014
.
Brasília
has
direct
flights
to
all
states
of
Brazil
and
direct
international
flights
to
Atlanta
,
Buenos
Aires
,
Lisbon
,
Miami
,
Panama
City
,
and
Paris
.
The
Juscelino
Kubitschek
bridge
,
also
known
as
the
'
President
JK
Bridge
'
or
the
'
JK
Bridge
'
,
crosses
Lake
Paranoá
in
Brasília
.
It
is
named
after
Juscelino
Kubitschek
de
Oliveira
,
former
president
of
Brazil
.
It
was
designed
by
architect
Alexandre
Chan
and
structural
engineer
Mário
Vila
Verde
.
Chan
won
the
Gustav
Lindenthal
Medal
for
this
project
at
the
2003
International
Bridge
Conference
in
Pittsburgh
due
to
"
...
outstanding
achievement
demonstrating
harmony
with
the
environment
,
aesthetic
merit
and
successful
community
participation
"
.
The
metro
leaves
the
Rodoviária
(
bus
station
)
and
goes
south
,
avoiding
most
of
the
political
and
tourist
areas
.
The
main
purpose
of
the
metro
is
to
serve
cities
,
such
as
Samambaia
,
Taguatinga
and
Ceilândia
,
as
well
as
Guará
and
Águas
Claras
.
The
satellite
cities
served
are
more
populated
in
total
than
the
Plano
Piloto
itself
(
the
census
of
2000
indicated
that
Ceilândia
had
344,039
inhabitants
,
Taguatinga
had
243,575
,
whereas
the
Plano
Piloto
had
approximately
400,000
inhabitants
)
,
and
most
residents
of
the
satellite
cities
depend
on
public
transportation
.
In
the
original
city
plan
,
the
interstate
buses
should
also
stop
at
the
Central
Station
.
Because
of
the
growth
of
Brasília
(
and
corresponding
growth
in
the
bus
fleet
)
,
today
the
interstate
buses
leave
from
the
older
interstate
station
(
called
Rodoferroviária
)
,
located
at
the
western
end
of
the
Eixo
Monumental
.
The
Central
Bus
Station
also
contains
a
main
metro
station
.
A
new
bus
station
was
opened
in
July
2010
.
It
is
on
Saída
Sul
(
South
Exit
)
near
Parkshopping
Mall
and
with
its
metro
station
,
and
it
's
also
an
inter-state
bus
station
,
used
only
to
leave
the
Federal
District
.
Brasília
is
known
as
a
departing
point
for
the
practice
of
unpowered
air
sports
,
sports
that
may
be
practiced
with
hang
gliding
or
paragliding
wings
.
Practitioners
of
such
sports
reveal
that
,
because
of
the
city
's
dry
weather
,
the
city
offers
strong
thermal
winds
and
great
"
cloud-streets
"
,
which
is
also
the
name
for
a
manoeuvre
quite
appreciated
by
practitioners
.
In
2003
,
Brasília
hosted
the
14th
Hang
Gliding
World
Championship
,
one
of
the
categories
of
free
flying
.
In
August
2005
,
the
city
hosted
the
2nd
stage
of
the
Brazilian
Hang
Gliding
Championship
.
